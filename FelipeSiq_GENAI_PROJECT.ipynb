            "Well, he was a Christmas present when Ashley was about eight and I was about 10. And when he first arrived he was really fluffy. And he was this beautiful, fluffy, white duck. And he had a cape on and black kind of villain/hero goggles. I guess we'd call it hero goggles. And I think he was, because there was an S on his cape, I'm sure he was supposed to be Superduck or something.\n",

She would produce the Duki-like voice. And Duki was sarcastic and selfish and bossy. Duki would insult and tease Danielle and give her painful nose squeaks.\n",

Very, very concerned about if other people are happy or if someone else doesn't feel good. And Duki has this total \"What's for lunch?\" attitude, like \"What's in it for me?\" in your face, totally out for himself, simultaneously a braggart and a total wimp.\n",

            "18 years after Duki arrived in the Mattoon household, I can say, I think fairly accurately, that the fluffy whiteness is long gone. \"Fluffy\" is not a word-- you would never use that word with Duki anymore. Nor is two-eyed, actually, if I remember correctly.\n",

            "Danielle\n",
            "Very tattered. But then the fact that his brain, like what's coming out of his mouth, is in complete denial about who he actually is. I don't know. There's just something really, really great about that. And really, you have to love-- you love him for it.\n",
            "Ira Glass\n",
            "OK, I have been at Danielle's house sometimes and witnessed the following scene. Picture this. Danielle has not spoken with her sister in weeks, picks up the phone, calls her sister Ashley in Michigan. Ashley answers. Danielle asks immediately, \"Can you put Duki on the line?\" And then Ashley essentially becomes Duki, puts Duki on the line. Danielle talks to Duki for 15, 20 minutes. And then they both hang up. That's the whole conversation. And they both feel satisfied.\n",
            "Danielle\n",
            "I adore Duki. I really love Duki. And sometimes I think if he disappeared, it would really feel like someone died. I mean, I look at him and he looks really old and ratty. And it really makes me sad.\n",
            "Really, I feel like-- it sounds crazy. It really makes me sad to think about a world without Duki, and that it would be a big, empty hole in the world. He takes up as much room in my heart as a lot of people individually. And if something happened to him, if he were lost at an airport or run over by a car, it would really be heartbreaking.\n",
            "Ira Glass\n",
            "So I hope that it's becoming clear why, when you eat dinner in the home of Danielle's family, if they are serving some kind of poultry, chicken or turkey, if you ask anyone in the family what's for dinner, they'll tell you--\n",

            "Right. And the rationale for that is what?\n",
            "Danielle\n",
            "It freaks Duki out.\n",
            "Ira Glass\n",
            "It freaks him out, though-- you don't like him to know that perhaps some birds are, in fact, eaten?\n",
            "Danielle\n",
            "I think he knows. I think he's in denial about it. He's in denial about most things. He's in denial about the fact that he's totally weak and tiny and dirty. He thinks he's really good-looking and strong, and that he's really smart and has a lot of friends.\n",
            "He's in denial about the fact that he's actually stuffed, which he is. Sometimes I tell him that. I say, \"Duki, give me a break. You're just stuffed.\" And he's like, \"No way.\"\n",
            "Ira Glass\n",
            "Now I thought I would try to book Duki to come on the radio for this show. So a few weeks ago, I contacted Danielle's sister, Ashley. And I asked her if Duki could come on the air.\n",
            "And I didn't get a call back. I got an answer back by electronic mail that for Duki to appear, I would have to call someone named Yona Lu, who I could reach through Danielle and Ashley's mom. And when I talked with Danielle, I asked her about this.\n",

            "OK. In Danielle's family-- I guess you're figuring this out. There's Duki. There's Yona Lu. And then there are four or five other characters, Therese-- I can never keep all their names straight-- who live in this world that's fleshed out with a lot of vivid detail and drama. They have a club called The Smart Set, and people are forever falling in and out of favor with The Smart Set.\n",
            "Anyway, there are jealousies. There are rivalries. People fight for favors and treats and invitations to ice cream socials. And each of the characters corresponds to some stuffed doll that Danielle and Ashley received as children.\n",
            "Though a few months ago, Danielle and Ashley were talking. And they realized that one of the characters, Guy Frank, didn't seem to correspond to any particular doll that they could remember. Where did he come from?\n",
            "They attempted to recall this. And then one of them did. Guy Frank is Duki's imaginary friend. Duki is such a fully realized imaginary friend that he has his own imaginary friend.\n",
            "As you might imagine, not everyone in the family takes all this so lightly. Danielle's father, for example, was never too keen on it.\n",
            "Mrs. Mattoon\n",
            "He was quite actually bothered by the whole-- he thought we maybe had a problem in the family.\n",

            "Really?\n",
            "Mrs. Mattoon\n",

            "Yeah. That period that you're describing, when do you mean?\n",
            "Mrs. Mattoon\n",
            "I would say they maybe were 10 and 12 or 9 and 11.\n",
            "Ira Glass\n",
            "And they would only communicate through the duck?\n",
            "Mrs. Mattoon\n",
            "Well, Danielle didn't pay a whole lot of attention to Ashley but she paid quite a lot of attention to the duck. So if Ashley wanted to get Danielle's attention all she had to do was rev up the duck. Danielle thought Duki was very funny, but I can't remember her thinking Ashley was funny.\n",
            "Danielle\n",
            "In terms of the relationship between my sister and me, this is probably completely really sick. But I have so much genuine affection and love for Duki that it's very easy to demonstrate those feelings. It's not as easy to demonstrate those feelings toward my sister, just because we never got in the habit of it.\n",
            "Ira Glass\n",
            "What percentage of your relationship with your sister is based on your relationship with Duki?\n",
            "Danielle\n",
            "Well, the really fun part of it is based on my relationship with Duki. But I think kind of a big chunk. It definitely gives me this vision into her brain that I wouldn't have otherwise.\n",
            "Ira Glass\n",
            "Well, I did finally snag an interview with Duki by calling Ashley.\n",

            "I'm Julie Showalter. I grew up on a turkey farm in southwest Missouri. \"The night 3,000 turkeys died.\" The day before the night that 3,000 turkeys died, we moved 13,000 turkeys to the range.\n",
            "This requires some explanation. Turkeys spend their first 16 weeks in a heated brooder house. When they are 16 weeks old, they are put outside to range in fenced enclosures.\n",
            "Daddy decided we would herd them to the range. It looked simple enough. We made a temporary chute of wire fencing that ran from the double-end doors of the brooder house 50 yards to the pen. We would get behind the turkeys in the brooder house, shout, wave old shirts and gunny sacks at them, and they would run out the doors, through the chute, into the pen.\n",
            "And that's the way it worked in the first brooder house. The first turkeys hesitated at the door, walked out cautiously, then moved through the chute and dispersed. The rest followed. It took about an hour. Daddy was pleased. \"Let's work straight through,\" he said. \"We'll be done by 10:00.\"\n",
            "By the time the turkeys have been in a brooder house for 16 weeks, the air is filled with ammonia, feather particles, and dust. The stench is overwhelming. After an hour in the brooder house, your lungs hurt for a day.\n",
            "You can contract disabling lung diseases from working only a week in a poultry house. Tiny barbed pieces of feather dig into the tissue of your lung and never let go. But we didn't know that then.\n",
            "We moved the temporary fence to the doors of the second brooder house. When we threw open the doors at the end of the second house, it was 9:00 in the morning. The sun streamed in the open doors on turkeys that had never seen direct sunlight.\n",
            "The one thing you can count on with turkeys is that you never know how they are going to react. I've seen turkeys clamber against a fence trying to get into a range fire. I've seen them rush toward a screaming child, trying to kill it. And I've seen them run from a screaming child, spooked and terrified.\n",
            "These turkeys didn't want to go into the sun. As we pushed from behind, they compacted. It was like an old adventure movie where the walls are closing in. But there was no wall at the end, only a patch of sunlight which turkeys would not touch.\n",
            "We yelled louder, waved our cloths, kicked at the ones in the rear. Finally, Daddy walked through the solid carpet of turkeys to break the logjam at the front. He stood at the edge of the sunlight, lifting the turkeys three or four at a time with his feet, stirring them with this legs, forcing them into the sun.\n",
            "Suddenly, they broke free. As stubbornly as they had refused to go into the light, they now rushed toward it. They ran in a panic, piling on top of each other, knocking down the temporary fence. By the time Daddy could get the doors closed, at least 1,000 turkeys had escaped and were running free on the farm, onto our neighbor's farm, into the road.\n",
            "We didn't own the turkeys. We raised them for a company that owned the hatchery, the feed mill, the fleet of trucks that delivered and loaded the turkeys, the processing plant. We got a portion of the profits, if there were profits.\n",
            "With 1,000 turkeys gone, there would be no profits on this flock. 16 weeks of Daddy working 14-hour days, of my sisters and me working alongside him any time we weren't in school, all for no pay. And if we weren't paid for this flock, we would have no cash coming in until the next flock was raised.\n",
            "It took us eight hours to round up the escaped turkeys, four of us trying to track down 1,000 birds that had the whole world in which to hide and run from us. The sun beat down, and the air was thick and humid. We stopped once for water, and my sister, Billie, the youngest of us, just 11, vomited from the cold water hitting her stomach after hours of sun, heat, and dehydration.\n",
            "As she lay on the ground, shaking and holding her stomach, I hated her for being the one too sick to continue. But even she was not too sick. We all went on. She got an extra five minutes to rest, but we all went on.\n",
            "You may be asking right now how my father could be so cruel, how he could work young girls like that? Or you may think that I'm exaggerating, that self-pity has magnified our distress. I tell you, this is no exaggeration. And I tell you, my father had no choice. Or that any choice he had was so far in the past that there was no unraveling it. Years later, when we were grown, we caught a glimpse of his guilt, his bitterness over what he had done to us. \"I couldn't afford n------,\" he told my sister Billie. \"So I had daughters.\"\n",
            "At 6 o'clock, we rebuilt the chute. We opened the doors, and the 6,000 remaining turkeys, the sun now low in the sky behind them, walked through to the pen. We cleaned up. We ate supper. And we went to bed. That's the day we had before the night 3,000 turkeys died.\n",
            "At midnight, Mother woke us up. \"We have to get to the pen. Daddy needs us.\" We had been too exhausted to hear the storm. We ran out in the driving rain. Flashes of lightning showed Daddy picking up turkeys and throwing them, one after the other.\n",
            "When people learn I grew up on a turkey farm, they invariably ask, \"Is it true? Are they really so stupid that they open their mouths in the rain, look up at the sky, and drown?\" The answer is yes, some of them do that. They are that stupid. But that's not how 3,000 die in one night.\n",
            "They die because they are scared, and they huddle together in their fear. They climb on top of each other, trying to get close, to find protection in the mass of bodies. And they suffocate.\n",
            "We called it piling. It wasn't unusual for a loud noise to cause a pile in the brooder house. If there wasn't someone to pull them off each other, 50 could die because someone slammed a door.\n",
            "But this was worse than any pile we'd seen, turkeys who'd never spent a night outdoors panicked by thunder, lightning, and rain in sheets. All we could do is pull them out of the pile and throw them away from it. They would run back, still seeking the comfort of the group.\n",
            "After a while standing in mud, grabbing soaked turkeys, throwing them, grabbing more, you don't know if the ones you are throwing are dead or alive. You don't care. Maybe we saved some.\n",
            "The next day, the sky was cloudless, and the sun bore down on us again. We picked up dead turkeys, throwing them onto the back of a flatbed truck. Daddy drove the truck into a field far from the house. He poured gasoline on them and struck a match. They burned for days.\n",

            "This is Luis Rodriguez. And I'm going to read my poem, \"The Rooster Who Thought it Was a Dog.\" Echo Park mornings came on the wings of a rooster's gnawing squawk. This noise, unfortunately, also brought in the afternoon, evenings, and most hours of the day. The rooster had no sense of time, nor any desire to commit to one. He'd cock-a-doodle whenever he had the notion.\n",
            "For late sleepers, day sleepers, or your plain, ordinary, run of the mill night sleepers, annoyance had this rooster's beak. It was enough to drive one crazy. Often, I open my back window that faced the alley just across from the backyard where the rooster made his home. \"Shut up, or I'll blow your stinking brains out,\" I'd yell. Great communication technique.\n",
            "It worked on the brats next door, but the rooster never flinched. With calm aplomb, it continued to squawk. For one thing, the rooster never gave out a bona fide cock-a-doodle. It sort of shouted it out.\n",
            "It happened that the rooster lived with three dogs, a German Shepherd and two mutts. The dogs barked through their existence. They barked at everything in sight. I finally concluded that rooster thought it was a dog. Somehow, I didn't mind the dogs barking. But when a rooster barks, that's murder.\n",
            "In fact, I often saw it running alongside the dogs as they raced across the dirt yard, barking at passing cars or people. If the dogs went left, the rooster went left. They'd go right, and dang if that rooster didn't go right as well. Now I don't know if this is a regular condition for roosters.\n",

            "But once I grasped the heart of the matter, I began to see the rooster in another light. I felt sorry for this fowl with an identity problem. And I wondered how it must react when its owners threw chicken bones to the dogs. Would it nibble on the remains of its favorite hen? I shuddered at the thought.\n",
            "Yet despite the revelation of the rooster's bark, the problem of sleep didn't end. Then one day, a new neighbor, a young lady, who often drank herself to bliss, got a gun and blew the rooster away. She became somewhat of a local hero.\n",
            "I must say, though, it was an unfitting end for the bird. But I suppose one can tolerate barking dogs. But barking roosters? That's another matter altogether.\n",

Nobody really knows what to expect from you, he says. \"Right now, it is stretching in front of us, a perfect future yet to be fulfilled,\" Glass says. Ira Glass: The name of this show is YourRadioPlayhouse. The idea is we're going to bring you stuff you're not going to find anywhere else. And tonight's show, we thought that we would have a theme. It's going to be New Beginnings. Joe Franklin's talk show ran for 43 years on local television in New York. He claims that he invented the talk show format. Franklin: \"It's a matter of paying attention. And when the guest is sitting with you, you've got to look into his eyes. And above all, get the plug fast\" The main ingredient for longevity in the talk show field, the main ingredient is sincerity. Once you learn to fake that, then you got it made. I was a natural born talker, I guess. Eye contact is everything. And as I say, it's a lot of fun. Joe Franklin: I'm going to be a listener and a fan. Ira, calledUpLatewithJoeFranklinfrom Simon & Schuster. If you find a copy in the store--Ira GlassYou see now, I guess I've sort of messed that one up, because I didn't let you get in your plug early. Kevin Kelly spent most of his twenties wandering around Asia. He found himself photographing a lot of religious ceremonies. He says that he was really confused about what he believed. And he was the kind of person who had always dreamt about a new beginning. Ira Glass: What happened to Kevin Kelly when he came into Jerusalem on the eve of Easter and Passover? Glass: He got locked out of his hostel room. He didn't have enough money to stay elsewhere, nor did he even have knowledge of where to go. The Old Town of Jerusalem at night, which had been shuttered up and was like a time machine. It was as if I had been transported back to the 15th century, because all the souvenir vendors were gone. And I wandered around for a number of hours, and it was getting colder. Eventually, I found myself at the one place that was still open, which was some of the churches. I slept there until early morning, when the activity started to increase, and people started coming in. And I went out and followed the crowd where it was going when they were going out to the tombs area in Jerusalem. And there were some folding chairs set up in front of this tomb area. And as the sun was coming up on that Easter morning, I was staring at empty tombs. Having that realization that I believe that Jesus Christ had actually risen from those tombs did not settle 1,001 other things about what one was supposed to do with that. And that is, in fact, what occupied my mind as I went back to my hostel to lay down and think about. Because I had no clue what it really meant to me ultimately, and that's what I was pondering. \"I'm a pretty rational person. I'm pretty logical. And after thinking the thought that I should live as if I was going to die in six months, the first thought that comes to my head was, \"Well, that's pretty silly. I have no evidence whatsoever\" But at the same time, it was equally probable that I might die in 6 months. It happened all the time. There was no guarantee that I wouldn't die. \"I was really shocked by that, because I thought that with six months to live, I would climb Mount Everest, or I would go scuba diving to the depths of the ocean,\" he says. \"Instead, I wanted to go back home and be with my family for that time\" \"I found myself relishing the ordinariness and finding it in some ways as exotic as anything that I had traveled to see\" \"I helped around the house. I dug up shrubs. I worked on a deck. I moved furniture, washed dishes\" Ira Glass: I mailed cashier's checks for $500 and $1,000 to various people anonymously. He says the people had no idea who had sent them that money. Glass: It was really remarkable to see the consequences of getting an anonymous gift like that. I had enough money left over to basically pay for food and whatnot on my bicycle journey across America. The path that I had to visit all my brothers and sisters was not a direct route. I actually had to go up to Idaho, and back down to Texas, and then back up through Indiana. So it was a 5,000 mile trip. \"I often retreat to the future. trouble staying in the present,\" he says. \"The future that I found so hard to give up was a much more insidious type\" \"The thought of doing something now for the enjoyment, or the pleasures, was extremely difficult and difficult\" \"I was able, by the last weeks, to not think about my life beyond Halloween,\" he says. \"I decided that it was an entirely unnatural and inhumane way to live\" \"Having a future is part of what being human is about,\" he adds. \"There were days when I did pray that, that if I didn't have to die, I really would rather not,\" he says. \"I think I did experience some of that, not because I had the same weight. It was just my own life. But Jesus prayed that this burden be lifted\" \"I came in to their house on Halloween day. And I was so filled with ideas, and things, and emotions, that I didn't really say very much\" \"I think we had a wonderful dinner. They were, of course, glad to see me because they hadn't seen me in a long time\" Kevin Kelly is 43 now. That happened when he was 27. In his latest rebirth, he is the executive editor of The New York Times. Kelly: \"I was reborn into ordinariness. But what more could one ask for?\" This is your first evening of YourRadioPlayhouse on WBEZ Chicago. Ira Glass calls his parents in Baltimore to ask for advice on his new radio show. He tells us that he wasn't even sure he has ever even told his parents this story. Ira Glass' new show goes on the air this week. \"This is what it's like with my parents. They're so busy. Call them. Put on hold. [SINGING] Baby, what's your hurry?\" Ira Glass: Are you and Dad still worried about me making a living in public radio? I know just for years, you were urging me to just get out and get, basically, any job in TV that I possibly could. But now that I've got my own show, are you guys still worried? Or do you feel like things are going OK? Do you want me to get into television still? The theme for this week is new beginnings. We have several stories, people telling about various ways in which their life began anew at some point. This is my whole life. I call my mom for an interview, and it's not even her first interview of the day. She's a therapist. Shirley Glass: There are a lot of people who are good at beginnings, but they're not good at middles. Glass: They like the beginning, where there's all this idealization and romantic projections. When they get to the middle phase--Ira Glass: Let's just make eye contact right now. Ira Glass: \"I'm better, I think, at middles than at beginnings\" \"I am much more comfortable with the notion of every day, work-a-day radio work,\" he says. \"We have gotten so deep here. I never expected that it was going to get so deep\" Shirley Glass: Are we going to get a tape of this since we're outside the Chicago listening area?Ira GlassDepending on how you sound, yeah. Lawrence Steger is a filmmaker and a performance artist. He's going back to Scotland in January to collaborate with the performance artist, Ron Athey. Lawrence Steger found out that he was HIV positive five years ago. On that day, he and a friend left on a cross-country car trip. We commissioned him to do a little piece about his experience. It's shot entirely on video, mostly handheld. The story concerns Luke, gay, white, Midwestern, late twenties. Follows Luke on the day that he is informed of his HIV positive status. Strauss's four last songs, particularly \"Ruhe, meine Seele!\" sung by Dame Janet Baker. The drama is constantly being undermined through the cool, collective quality of Luke's demeanor. Luke thinks he's sounding like a short story assignment in a creative writing class or, worse, trapped inside an artsy novel. Luke imagines himself in a television dramatization of himself. Bill pulls into the closest parking spot in the clinic, blows out the last of the one-hit, and, as he's knocking the brass pipe into the ashtray, turns to Luke with that slightly watery look in his eyes from too much intake. Luke takes it as one of those Care Bear looks that he's experienced before from Bill. Stephanie, the drag queen nurse, walks Luke back to the small cubicles that the tests are administered in and then used to relay the results. Luke's narrator imagines how many people have been in these cubicles and what they would look like if they were all piled on top of one another. Luke imagines himself in a George Tooker painting. He wonders what his sixth grade teacher would think of Stephanie. He imagines her body in the pileup of bodies who have come to the clinic. He thinks his narrator wants him to get out of the cubicle. Cut to interior of car pulling out of parking lot. Luke keeps looking straight ahead, as he murmurs, \"I'm positive\" Long, slow pan from back of Luke's head to the back of Bill's. This is the longest shot. They don't look at each other. I decided that it was an entirely unnatural and inhumane way to live. Having a future is part of what being human is about. When you take away the future for humans, you take a lot of the humanness. It's not actually a very good thing to live entirely in the present, that one needs to have a past. Ira Glass: Let's review our program so far. Our stories so far have been about people whose futures were taken from them and were thrown into the present in one way or another. Luke sees himself outside of his own story. He knows that he's on a long silent journey. Cut to black. Ed Ryder was wrongly imprisoned for 20 years. His sentence was commuted two years ago. And he found himself reborn into everyday life. \"Inside, I'm happy. Inside. whether you choose to or not,\" he says. \"I also dreamt of finding a very lovely lady, and I have,\" he adds. Ed Ryder played trumpet and sang with a jazz band while in Graterford Prison. He was released after evidence came forward. Ryder is now playing gigs in the real world. He doesn't have a CD yet, but he's playing. At Graterford, there is nothing you can do to make them feel better, except to release them. Just as long as they don't boo you, you're all right. If they can't find nothing wrong with the music, they'll tell you, \"You just didn't turn right\" Ed Ryder: In prison, the most important thing is to keep your eye on the future. He says the guys who just live in the present do really badly, because the present is so terrible. \"You're constantly hoping and hoping. You're trying to plan something for the future\" Ed Ryder: I had a tape of \"God Bless the Child That's Got His Own\" by Billie Holiday. He says it has the same meaning now, but it's different. Ryder: At Graterford, I thought that, yes, I was the child that had his own. \"I'm on my own differently because I'm not in prison anymore,\" he says. \"I have responsibilities now that I have to take care of. I have job responsibility\" \"All this now is dependent upon me and my own initiative,\" he adds. The Bible says the strong get more, while the weak ones fade. Money, you've got lots of friends. They all keep hanging around your door. But when money's gone and all of the spendings end, they don't come around. Ed Ryder's a big Billie Holiday fanatic. This show was produced by Dolores Wilber, Peter Clowney, Nancy Updike, Alix Spiegel, and myself. Contributing editors Paul Tough and Jack Hitt on the west coast, Margy Rochlin on the east coast. We'll be back next week, same time, we hope. Ira Glass: The great thing about starting a new show is utter anonymity. Nobody really knows what to expect from you. This interviewee did not know us from Adam. Right now, it is stretching in front of us, a perfect future yet to be fulfilled. Ira Glass: I know that somewhere out there, one or two of you are saying, \"Oh, sure. Back when it was still good.\" He says that force, that human desire to say that is so strong, that force is so basic to who we are. Glass: The idea of this show, this new little show, is stories. Joe Franklin's talk show ran for 43 years on local television in New York. He claims that he invented the talk show format. He gives advice on how to create a long-running, healthy program. He says it's a matter of paying attention. The main ingredient for longevity in the talk show field, Ira Glass says, is sincerity. And once you learn to fake that, then you got it made, he says. \"I was a natural born talker, I guess,\" Glass says. Joe Franklin: Imagine the thrill of John F. Kennedy walking into my studio. Richard Nixon. Ronald Reagan, five times. Bing Crosby. called anybody in my life to come on to my show. And I'm sure that they'll be coming to you too. Kevin Kelly spent most of his twenties wandering around Asia. He found himself photographing a lot of religious ceremonies. Kelly says that he was really confused about what he believed. He was the kind of person who had always dreamt about a new beginning. Ira Glass: What happened to Kevin Kelly when he came into Jerusalem on the eve of Easter and Passover. Glass: He entered Jerusalem on Easter with a simple expectation that he was going to photograph another religious ceremony. What happened is that at the age of 27, all of this changed. The Old Town of Jerusalem had been shuttered up and was like a time machine. It was as if I had been transported back to the 15th century. After wandering around until about 2:00 or 3:00 in the morning, I finally settled into the Church of the Holy Scepter. I slept on the crucifixion spot on that night because it was the only place-- they had no place in the inn. And I went out and followed the crowd where it was going when they were going out to the tombs area. And there were some folding chairs set up in front of this tomb area. At that very moment, I believed that Jesus Christ had, indeed, risen from those tombs. In an instant, the tension of trying to figure things out was resolved. It was as if you had been working on a problem for a long time and suddenly the answer was there. \"I could live like I'm going to die in six months and not die at all. It would just be an interesting exercise,\" he says. \"I wouldn't say it was a voice, but there was an idea that came into my mind that just would not go away\" \"There was no guarantee that I wouldn't die. And so fairly quickly, I decided that I could not settle that issue of whether I would really die or not,\" he says. \"What I wanted to do for six months was to go home and be ordinary,\" he adds. I wanted to go back home and be with my family for that time. I never told anybody why I was coming home. I had four brothers and sisters. And they were scattered all over the world. I was intending to spend my last remaining six months at home getting to know my parents better. I wanted to see them before I died, so I made up a will to dispose of the little things that I had. And I had some money left over. So I went to the bank and got some cashier's checks for $500 and $1,000. I mailed the money to various people anonymously as gifts. Ira Glass: Suspicion of goodness starts to infect the people that are around you. Glass: You look at someone, and you think, \"I wonder if he gave me that $1,000?\" And then you act really nice to him. I think there are a lot of people who have trouble staying in the present. The future that I found so hard to give up was a much more insidious type. It was that of I'd like to buy this record because, in the future, I want to hear this song again and again. And it's good. There was a sense in which my entire life was shifted to the future. And the thought of doing something now for the enjoyment, or the pleasures, was extremely difficult and disconcerting. But I also decided that it was an entirely unnatural and inhumane way to live. It was a journey that began at the tomb of Jesus. And as I set off to my own presumed death, I did, indeed, think about Jesus Christ. Jesus's soul was in great turmoil and pain because of knowing that. And I think I did experience some of that, not because I had the same weight. \"I was so filled with ideas, and things, and emotions, that I didn't really say very much,\" he says. \"I think we had a wonderful dinner. They were, of course, glad to see me because they hadn't seen me in a long time\" \"I went to bed that night, which was a very difficult thing to do because I was fully prepared at that point never to wake up again,\" he says. \"I had been praying. I had gotten everything arranged. And I didn't know what was going to happen the next day\" Kevin Kelly is 43 now. That happened when he was 27. In his latest rebirth, he is the executive editor ofWiredmagazine. He told us that he wasn't even sure he has ever even told his parents this story, even this many years later. Ira Glass calls his parents in Baltimore for advice on his new radio show. \"This is what it's like with my parents. They're so busy. Call them. Put on hold. [Singing] Baby, what's your hurry?\" Ira Glass calls his mother, Shirley, to get her advice on his new radio show. She says he's in danger of appealing to a narrow range of listeners if it becomes a little too-- I don't know what word to use. \"There's a lot of Disney music,\" she says. Shirley Glass: Hugh Grant is such a big star, and everybody who sees you or sees your picture thinks how much you look like Hugh Grant, that fires up that TV thing again in me. But now that I've got my own show, are you guys still worried? Or do you feel like things are going OK? Do you want me to get into television still? Shirley Glass: I call my mom for an interview, and it's not even her first interview of the day. I was lucky to get a booking. She's a therapist, and sometimes she gets called by the papers and stuff. She says there are a lot of people who are good at beginnings, but not good at middles. Ira Glass: \"I just don't want any idealizing on either side\" \"I'm better, I think, at middles than at beginnings,\" he says. \"I am much more comfortable with the notion of every day, work-a-day\" Shirley Glass: Are we going to get a tape of this since we're outside the Chicago listening area?Ira GlassDepending on how you sound, yeah. I'm just very pleased at how deep this has gotten. Next on our little playhouse stage, we have Mr. Lawrence Steger. Lawrence Steger is a filmmaker and a performance artist. He found out that he was HIV positive five years ago. On that day, he and a friend left on a cross-country car trip. Steger commissioned him to do a little piece about his experience. The story concerns Luke, gay, white, Midwestern, late twenties. Follows Luke on the day that he is informed of his HIV positive status. Luke cops a stance of cold, brittle, not unlike the Harrison Ford narration onBladeRunner. There's a hint of vulnerability to Luke. The drama is constantly being undermined through the cool, collective quality of Luke's demeanor. Strauss's four last songs, particularly \"Ruhe, meine Seele!\" sung by Dame Janet Baker, are too mournful. There's really no music on the soundtrack. Luke imagines himself in a television dramatization of himself. \"The ceiling of the car must be incredibly high,\" he thinks to himself. When Bill asks him, \"What are you thinking about?\" Luke responds, \"I'm sure I'll get a handle on it\" In the scene that we talked about on the phone, the clinic waiting room scene, that scene flips back and forth between various security black-and-white cameras mounted at the ceilings. The nurse assigned to Luke's anonymous number is a black drag queen named Stephanie. Luke's narrator imagines how many people have been in these cubicles and what they would look like if they were all piled on top of one another. He wonders if his sixth grade teacher was ever tested. He imagines her body in the pileup of bodies who have come to the clinic. Cut to Bill in waiting room, flipping through People'sTheYearinPictures. Close-up on Luke's hand, no scratch. The walls seem to pulsate as Luke walks down the hallway to the reception area. Long, slow pan from the back of car. I decided that it was an entirely unnatural and inhumane way to live, and that having a future is part of what being human is about. When you take away the future for humans, you take a lot of the humanness, and it's not actually a very good thing to live entirely in the present. Lawrence Steger is a Chicago performance artist and filmmaker. Luke sees himself outside of his own story. He can't read the hitchhiker's sign. He knows that he's on a long silent journey. He leans over to turn off the radio. Cut to black.[MUSIC - \"(UH-OH) GET OUT OF THE CAR\" BY THE TRENIERS] Ed Ryder was wrongly imprisoned for 20 years. His sentence was commuted two years ago. And he found himself reborn into everyday life. He says it's been a real kick for him, getting up, cooking breakfast. \"I just-- I don't know. It seemed like the oxygen was even different,\" he says. Ed Ryder was in prison for murder and was doing time in Graterford Prison in Pennsylvania. A key witness who had testified against him admitted to lying while under oath. He was made a free man. And he's playing gigs in the real world. A prison is a good place to find musicians, says the singer. Prisoners have a tendency to think like classical musicians would, he says. At Graterford, there is nothing you can do to make them feel better, he adds. Ed Ryder: In prison, the most important thing is to keep your eye on the future. Ryder: The guys who just live in the present do really badly, because, of course, the present is so terrible. \"You're forced almost to. better, except to release them,\" Ryder says. Ira Glass asked Ed Ryder if he is still playing the same music now that his future is here and he's out. Ryder says he plays the same numbers now that he used to, though sometimes they mean something different to him today. \"God Bless the Child That's Got His Own\" by Billie Holiday has the same meaning now, but it's different. \"I felt like every time I would listen to that, I felt as though she was talking directly to me,\" he says. \"I had no help at the time. There was no hope. I seen no way. I was like a child\" \"I'm on my own now because I've got things that I have to do,\" he adds. \"I don't have no prison guards waking me up in the morning, telling me, \"Hey, it's time to get up,\" or \"It'stime to go eat, \" \" \"I'm on my own now,\" he says. \"You know the strong get more, while the weak ones fade. Empty pockets don't make the grade\" Ed Ryder joins us in the playhouse from the studios of WHYY in Philadelphia, speaking with me and associate producer Nancy Updike. Ed Ryder's a big Billie Holiday fanatic. So when we asked him to play a number with his horn, with his trumpet, he played \"Lover Man.\" We'll be back next week, same time, we hope.\n",

Transcripts are generated using a combination of speech recognition software and human transcribers. In 1983, he was one of the first victims of AIDS. He died before his children got the chance to ask him about who he really was. Susan Bergman wrote a book about her family's experience. Gay men, who were still married or who had been married, contacted her. Act One: The Book Tour. Act Two: A gay man talks to me in a parked car in an undisclosed location. Act Three: We take all the heavy, very heavy themes about lying and families and rework them as comedy. And finally, Act Four: The sins of the fathers pass on to the sons. Susan Bergman: \"There's always the resentment that you had to go through the pain\" \"You live with that resentment. It really never quite goes away, even in my case, after you've come completely out and divorced\" \"The resentment lives on, that I had to do live that lie,\" she says. \"And never be happy. Never, never, never know happiness\" Susan Bergman: I hope I can do this without just kind of gushing all over you, because it's so great of you to call in and offer that. I didn't get that chance with my father. I guess I would ask you--Ira Glass: As you're listening, you're making the gagging signal. Ira Glass: If what you really need is a long talk with your father, then no stranger on a radio call-in show, however well meaning, is going to give that to you. Glass: There you are. You're talking to this man, this stranger. And you find yourself asking a version of the question that you would most like to ask your own father. Gay men sent Susan Bergman photos of themselves. One letter said that if her father had lived and divorced her mother, this is the kind of happiness he could have had. Letters from children and spouses of gay fathers seemed to be written in a completely different language than the letters she got from the gay fathers. Ira Glass: Families who are in that situation felt this shock of we are not alone. And they contacted her. The most poignant letter that I got, this woman says she read the book. \"Our lives are so similar, Susan, that it was eerie for me to read\" Susan Bergman: The family had just buried their mother, who had died of AIDS. She says the father didn't protect the mother at all. \"Now, they are both gone. And we are left to deal with the fraud that was our life\" As her father was dying, Susan Bergman's children interviewed him about his sexual contacts. They got the names of all of the married men that he had been with in this three-city area. They began calling those men's wives on the telephone, because they wanted to save lives. Susan Bergman: \"I can see why if you lose your mother to AIDS, I never had to do that\" In a town I live in, outside Chicago, there is a family, at least one, where the same thing is going on. The father is very promiscuous, a prominent man in town, has four young children. Susan Bergman: I can't go into their lives just because I wrote some book on some related subject. If they're involved in the family system in some way, they have to make that decision. When I talk to gay men about this book, who have read it and want to have a conversation, almost everyone has said to me, \"Oh yeah, my main partners are married men\" \"I strongly feel that your father's life with you and your family was not the sham it may superficially appear\" \"I see the story from a different perspective, as that of a tragic, often unconscious struggle by your father to love his family and not end up as one of nature's mistakes, which of course he wasn't\" \"I had a great Daddy in many regards. Yes, he was a split person. And I don't think that he enjoyed being split, and neither does this gentleman\" \"I think I was well-loved by my father. But that doesn't make him a better father,\" he says. Coming up, a gay father explains why he chooses not to tell his children of his double life. The man we found to interview for this has been married for 26 years, heads a support group for men in similar circumstances. He was willing to be interviewed, but he didn't want me coming to his home. Jerry Walters says he was always a good boy. He says he doesn't really get at angry people, doesn't know how to yell at people. Back in high school, he says, he'd go out with girls, but never make passes at them. Ira Glass had his first gay experience the day he married the girl he's still married to. Soon after their wedding, he became increasingly obsessed with men. He found himself driving out to the forest preserves, where gay men were known to hang out. Ira Glass asks Jerry Walters about his obsession with another man. Walters: \"You're not sure who you want to do it with or where these people are\" Walters says his wife became the person that was stopping him from pursuing what he had to do to survive. Jerry Walters: I've got these feelings for men and I don't know how to deal with them. I'm one of these people that holds the door open for women and very courteous with people. So I held it inside. And you think the top of your head is going to blow off. \"I didn't marry part of you. We'll just figure out how to deal with it,\" Ira Glass says of his relationship with his wife. \"I want to be the most important person in your life,\" she says. \"And she always has been and she always will be,\" he says. Jerry Walters: There's a difference between gay feelings and living the gay lifestyle. He says there's no easy time to sit your kids down and tell them that you're gay. Walters: When they hit adolescence, it could be confusing, a kind of burden. Jerry Walters says his children accept him for who he is. But they don't actually know entirely who you are, because you keep a certain part from them, he says. He says they'll ask when they're ready to hear the answer. If you want to know something, you will ask the question. Jerry Walters says his wife doesn't want anybody to know he has a sex life outside of the marriage. He says he'd like to tell his daughters the truth, but his wife wants him to respect her wishes. Jerry says he's not as sexually attracted to women as he is to men. To Jerry, being an adult means having a wife, a house in the burbs, a couple kids, dinner parties, and mortgage payments. \"How could I be anything other than what I am? And that was to be a married man\" In the suburbs, it's not commonplace. In the city it's accepted. There are areas in the city where men can hold hands. You won't find that in the suburbs. long-term, marriage-like relationships are commonplace among the gay men I know. Ira Glass: Her father was, on the surface anyway, presented the image of being a family man, a very religious man. He was a musician in their church. And so there was this constant lie, because--Jerry WaltersWhere is the lie? Was he all of those things, plus one other thing? We are complicated individuals. Act Three: Lighten UpIra Glass: There are lots of trivial lies that parents tell. He says he urges men to think very seriously about what they'll be giving up if they choose to quit their marriages. Glass: A secret that my mom has kept from her kids involves sex. The Neo-Futurists are a Chicago group who perform 30 plays in 60 minutes every Friday and Saturday night. They prepared this play, they call it a play. It's by Greg Allen, a recent father himself. The play is called \"Twenty-one lies I will tell my children\" Greg Allen, Diana Slickman, Dave Awl, Heather Riordan, David Kodeski, Anita Loomis, and Stephanie Shaw, of the Neo-Futurists. Their parents can surprise us with what they don't tell us, especially when it comes to sex. My ex-girlfriend was in the gym, looking through a copy of aMarieClairemagazine. In the third paragraph, one of the sexperts turns out to be my mother. \"Your man wants a woman who excites him through her own excitement\" Anaheed was at the gym. And she opens upMarieClaireto an article called, \"Men's Sexual Fantasies\" \"Sexperts reveal the six most common scenarios, unlock the secret longings and psyches of the modern men who fantasize\" Shirley Glass: I might make a joke or say something that had a sexual connotation, and I'd get this disapproval. I think it has to do with that children, even adult children, do not like to regard their parents' sexuality. to around them. Shirley Glass: I heard a wonderful joke, but I don't even know if it's a joke or story. Because this is like something that might be true.Ira Glass: When Neil Armstrong walked on the moon, and he said, one giant step for man and one-- what is it? Shirley Glass: I did get very nervous there, in a way that does not correspond, perhaps, with shrugging my shoulders at the notion of you having some sexual life and sexual thoughts.Ira Glass: Well, now I'm examining my own feelings. Shirley Glass: We've gone to restaurants with you and pretended we didn't know you. I think everybody-- yeah. Daddy would look at you. And he would start popping Gelusil, before we'd go out to eat. And I'd say, now Barry, people are going to look at him and they're going to looks at him. Act Four: Sins Of The Fathers. Susan Bergman's book,Anonymity,is her trying to understand the two parts of her father, strict and strict. Dr. Shirley Glass, in Baltimore, is a well-known sexpert. Susan Bergman's husband is a religious, family man; promiscuous, gay, night clubber. His personality was split in half, she writes, into two irreconcilable halves. She found herself as an adult, leading a double life. \"I saw the way Tom looked at you.\" \"There's absolutely nothing for you to worry about between me and anyone here tonight. Most definitely nothing's up with Tom.\" \"Do you have any secrets from me?\" \"A few.\" She'll keep it light. There's a family with children on the line. I force my family to serve as the same kind of false front I was raised to be from my father. Here was my father's ailment again, his dread of being known. Our presence testified to his normality. We failed, no matter how we strove for blessing, to discover the root of our calamity. If her hands are clean and her heart pure, I had been forgiven. But I had yet to go to the man I had wronged, and whom I desperately wanted to love me. All that we had made together did not add up to the ultimate banishment of the untruthful from the presence of God. Ira Glass: I made an offer of honesty, yes, but hadn't thought the test would come so soon. Glass: Maybe it was a morning unlike any my father had ever been given. \"Whatever the consequence,\" I said inside my head to remind myself, breathing once. Ira Glass: Susan Bergman's father led a double life. He was a church organist in a denomination so strict the women covered their heads. He stage-managed things so they appeared to be a normal family. Cushing, and the mysterious and elusive Rumpety Rattles. Susan Bergman wrote a book about her family's experience. Gay men, who were still married or who had been married, started to contact her. They wanted to explain her father's double life to her. And they wanted to offer her the conversation that she never got to have with her father. Today's program in four acts. I talk to Susan Bergman about her father. Act Two, a gay man talks to me in a parked car in an undisclosed location. Act Three, we take all the heavy, very heavy themes about lying and families and rework them as comedy. Susan Bergman: I'm a gay father, divorced now. So I'm very close to this. In particular, I can understand your father's secretiveness and his pain. There's always the resentment that you had to go through the pain. And you live with that resentment. Susan Bergman: I would have to contest that assumption that one has to lie or one is put in a situation where lying is the only appropriate gesture or response. Man: Is there anything that I can help you. Because I'm still alive and I've been through it. Ira Glass: If what you really need is a long talk with your father, then no stranger on a radio call-in show, however well meaning, is going to give that to you. Glass: Whatever anger I would have had towards my father didn't seem to me to apply to him. Gay men sent Susan Bergman photos of themselves. One letter said that if her father had lived and divorced her mother, this is the kind of happiness he could have had. She said the letters that she got from the children and spouses of gay fathers seemed to be written in a completely different language. There are lots of books about men coming out. But nobody seemed to be able to remember a book that had been told from the point of view of the children and the wives that these gay men had left behind. And families who are in that situation felt this shock of we are not alone. Susan Bergman: A Chicago family lost both their parents to AIDS. She says the family wrote to her asking for help. They did come to Chicago. Two of the daughters came. Some of the sons were not willing to even acknowledge that the parents had died of AIDS yet. As her father was dying, they spent hours and hours interviewing their father on tape about his sexual contacts. They got the names of all of the married men that he had been with in this three-city area. And they began calling those men's wives on the telephone, because they wanted to save lives. Susan Bergman: It's such a complicated act, because partly it's an act of compassion for somebody. And then it's such anact of vengeance against somebody else, and calling out that man. go on. And they said a lot of women hung up the phone. Susan Bergman: I don't know the people. I can't go into their lives just because I wrote some book on some related subject. But when I talk to gay men about this book, who have read it and want to have a conversation, almost everyone has said to me, \"Oh yeah, my main partners are married men\" \"I did the one right thing. I left my family and became a true homosexual,\" Bergman writes. \"I see the story from a different perspective, as that of a tragic, often unconscious struggle by your father to love his family,\" he writes. I think I was well-loved by my father. I think my father was a split person, and that that destroyed him and it worked towards the destruction of his family. And that's almost the thing that this letter is driving towards, like couldn't you be doubly loved, being loved by a homosexual father? No. Coming up, a gay father explains why he chooses not to tell his children of his double life. The man we found to interview for this has been married for 26 years, heads a support group, called Review. He was willing to be interviewed, but he didn't want me coming to his home. Jerry Walters says he was always a good boy. He says he doesn't really get at angry people, doesn't know how to yell at people. Back in high school, he says, he was the kind of boy who'd go out with girls, but never make passes. Ira Glass had his first gay experience the day he met his wife. He went on to marry the girl, who he's still married to nearly three decades later. But soon after their wedding, he became increasingly obsessed with men. He found himself driving out to the forest preserves, where gay men were known to hang out. Ira Glass: Jerry Walters' obsession with another man led him to take tranquilizers. Glass: His wife became the person that was stopping him from pursuing what he absolutely, positively had to do to survive. \"Your thinking gets distorted, would be an understatement,\" Glass says. Jerry Walters: I'm one of these people that holds the door open for women and very courteous with people. So I held it inside. And it's something that we-- here's a very mild mannered person, almost plotting somebody's demise, because they're stopping you. Ira Glass says his wife wanted to know where he would be when she needed him. \"I'm going out for sex, not for sleeping,\" he says. Glass: \"I want to be the most important person in your life\" Jerry Walters: There's a difference between gay feelings and living the gay lifestyle. There is an arrested adolescence in the gay community, he says. He says he's not really lying to his children by not telling them he's gay. Walters: honesty is something that I really put a high price on and I really value it. Jerry Walters says his children accept him for who he is, but they don't actually know entirely who you are, because you keep a certain part from them. If his children ask him directly he says, then he'll tell the truth. He says, they'll ask when they're ready to hear the answer. Jerry says that he'd like to tell his daughters the truth, but his wife doesn't want him to. He feels he has to respect her wishes. She knows the marriage works for them and simply doesn't. want to have to put up with the opinions of people who won't understand. Jerry Walters says he's not sexually attracted to women as much as he is to men. He stayed in his marriage partly because he couldn't imagine any other life for himself. To Jerry, being an adult means having a wife, a house in the burbs, a couple kids and dinner parties. Ira Glass tells Jerry Walters that these kind of long-term, marriage-like relationships are commonplace among the gay men I know. In the suburbs, it's not commonplace. There are areas in the city where men can hold hands. You won't find that in the suburbs. Ira Glass: Her father was, on the surface anyway, presented the image of being a family man, a very religious man. He was a musician in their church. And he was just this one more thing, that he didn't choose to share with her. And I think that was his privilege. Act Three: Lighten Up. Jerry says he talks to about 260 men a year in the support group he leads for gay and bisexual married men. He urges men to think very seriously about what they'll be giving up if they choose to quit their marriages. The Neo-Futurists are a Chicago group who perform 30 plays in 60 minutes every Friday and Saturday night. They prepared this play on our theme today. It's by Greg Allen, a recent father himself. The play is called \"Twenty-one lies I will tell my children\" Greg Allen, Diana Slickman, Dave Awl, Heather Riordan, David Kodeski, Anita Loomis, and Stephanie Shaw are members of the Neo-Futurists. Their show, \"Curtain,\" airs on PBS stations in the U.S. An ex-girlfriend was in the gym, looking through a copy of aMarieClairemagazine, a woman's magazine. In the third paragraph, one of the sexperts turns out to be my mother. \"Your man wants a woman who excites him through her own excitement\" Shirley Glass was quoted inMarieClaire.com. She says she didn't know she was a sexpert. She's just another Jewish mom and psychologist, she says. \"I think I'm just going to let that go. it.\" Shirley Glass: I might make a joke or say something that had a sexual connotation, and I'd get this disapproval. I think it has to do with that children, even adult children, do not like to regard their parents' sexuality. So therefore, I tend not to around them. Shirley Glass: I heard a wonderful joke, but I don't even know if it's a joke or story. Because this is like something that might be true. Neil Armstrong walked on the moon, and he said, one giant step for man and one-- what is it? Shirley Glass: I did get very nervous there, in a way that does not correspond, perhaps, with shrugging my shoulders at the notion of you having some sexual life and sexual thoughts.Ira Glass: Well, now I'm examining my own feelings. Shirley Glass: I've gone to restaurants with you and pretended we didn't know you. I think everybody-- yeah. Daddy would look at you. And he would start popping Gelusil, before we'd go out to eat. And I'd go along with it. Act Four: Sins Of The Fathers. What does it do to children if parents tell a big lie for years? Part of Susan Bergman's \"Sins of the Fathers\" Dr. Shirley Glass, in Baltimore, was the author's mother. Susan Bergman's book, Anonymity, is about trying to understand the two parts of her father. His personality was split in half, she writes, into two irreconcilable halves. She found herself as an adult, leading a double life. \"I saw the way Tom looked at you.\" \"There's absolutely nothing for you to worry about between me and anyone here tonight\" \"Do you have any secrets from me?\" \"A few.\" She'll keep it light. \"This is not my natural hair color, quite. But the rest is real.\" There's a family with children on the line. I force my family to serve as the same kind of false front I was raised to be from my father. Our presence testified to his normality. We failed, no matter how we strove for blessing, to discover the root of our calamity. If her hands are clean and her heart pure, I had been forgiven. But I had yet to go to the man I had wronged, and whom I desperately wanted to love me. All that we had made together did not add up to the ultimate banishment of the untruthful. Ira Glass left her father's house to start a new life on her own. She says she made an offer of honesty, but hadn't thought the test would come so soon. Glass: \"This was the last of my life, as I knew it\" Ira Glass: You'll get oral sex from me the day that boy next door walks on the moon. This American Life is produced by WBEZ in Chicago.

If you are able, we strongly encourage you to listen to the audio, which includes emotion and emphasis that's not on the page. Transcripts are generated using a combination of speech recognition software and human transcribers. K-Rad, Mr. Warez, and Fred were trying to be criminals. But they were not too successful at this. At a McDonald's on Times Square in New York City, they told all. They're actually in Manhattan for a computer hackers' convention this summer. K-Rad, Mr. Warez, and Fred were involved in very low-level types of crimes. They pirated software. They scammed free CD-ROM games. They cheated one of the big online computer services out of a few hundred dollars in online time. You have to sound like you've been sitting in this chair for 10 hours, and you want to go home. You say, \"I'm sorry. You seem to have a restriction on your phone line. You can't accept collect calls to this line.\" And then they yell, and they go, \"What do you mean, I can't accepting collect calls?\" K-rad: \"If you are thinking about doing this yourself right now, I should tell you one important fact. It doesn't work\" \"A good percentage of people, after the point at which they go through the mind-boggling experience of not understanding what it means to have a restriction on your line, then they'll just say, \"Oh, this is too much trouble\" K-Rad and Fred ordered $1,600 in computer merchandise on someone else's credit card. They had it delivered to a neutral address. They picked it up. They sold half of it for cash. They met a guy who was good at this and who taught them some tricks. Fred believes that he has no choice. He really suffers over money. He's this skinny, young-looking 15-year-old. And he is perpetually strapped for cash. His idea is that he wanted to replace the computer as quickly as he could with a stranger's credit card. Fred: \"I will not steal anything if I have the money for it\" K-rad: \"This is one thing that I absolutely guarantee that sounds like the biggest load of crap anyone could ever say\" Ira Glass: \"These boys want to convince themselves that they are good, and that what they do does not harm anyone\" K-Rad: If I ever find myself in a good enough financial situation, I will repay everything I have ever done now. If I find myself making $2 million a year, he says, he will send a $10,000 check to the company which he stole calling cards from. Fred: \"I lose 10 pounds in one week. And that's not good for someone who's really skinny, like I am\" \"I'd never beat someone up for money. I'd never shoplift. Well, maybe I-- no, I wouldn't shoplift,\" Fred says. Fred: \"It's like you're doing stuff that is not exactly legal, not legal at all. And it's fun\" \"We're not bad people. And we don't go around trying to screw all people in any way we can. Because we're not at all\" K-Rad says he's considering giving up on carding. He says computer hacking is a pure, zen pursuit. K-Rad: \"You break into the computer for its own sake and to look around, and for the knowledge of everyone\" Fred's worst fear is that he can end up going to hell for doing this. \"I want to get a gun and shoot you,\" Fred says to K-rad. \"It's always been my biggest fear. That's why I'm afraid of dying\" His share of the carding profits was $800. I told him that from an adult's perspective, this did not seem like a lot of money. Mr. Warez spoke up. He said that sure, maybe by adult standards, this wasn't much money. But to them, it was plenty enough to count. This is YourRadioPlayhouse is a radio experiment. We asked a Chicago playwright to write an original radio play that would pick up the themes where the boys leave off. So here's what he came up with. This is your radio playhouse. Caleb: I was born damned. I'm cowardly, petty, intolerant, lazy, and just generally destructive. Peter: Caleb, do you believe in sin? Caleb: Hell, no. I believe in damnation, though. Dondi: \"I will not make the mistake again, sahib\" Peter: \"What do you have? A pair of jacks?\" Dondi says: \"At the center of the ninth and innermost frozen circle of hell, Lucifer devours Judas eternally\" \"How many times do we have to go through this?\" \"5,000\" Dondi raises the pot to 1.5 million lira. Peter says he's afraid of going to hell. Caleb says he doesn't think he's a very good person. Dondi: Gentlemen, the game is Chicago low. Caleb: If you feel like it's bad enough to damn you, are you damned? I mean, if you don't feel any remorse? Peter: Remorse is truly feeling apologetic for what you've done, not just worrying about being punished for it. Caleb: What am I doing in Italy? Dondi: I don't remember deciding to come to Italy. Peter: I was in France, in Rouen, the town where Joan of Arc was burned at the stake. I was thinking about writing a letter, you know, apologizing. Go see the Pope. Ask for absolution. It was like staring into the abyss. I'd have to be truly sorry in my heart, or it wouldn't save me. If you buried your face in your hands and pretended to sob, I'm sure he'd buy it. I mean, the Pope's a nearsighted, distracted old man. \"The Golden Peacock\" was written for YourRadioPlayhouse by Jeff Dorchen. Lisa Stodder played Dondi and played the dying grandmother. Peter Handler played Peter. Michael Warr is a local poet and director of the Guild Complex. Michael Warr was raised as a Jehovah's Witness. The religion was a very multicultural type of religion. Warr noticed that when there were black people in the pictures, that the sisters, their heads were always covered. That was because there was a political issue that had not really been resolved. In high school, the natural was just like the Black Power sign. was a political statement. So I said to myself, well, if the sisters can't wear afros in paradise, I don't want to be there. I have a poem that I have written called \"Rules That Don't Work\" Slow dancing was wicked. To avoid temptation, we were to dance 18 inches apart, a safe 18 inches. The first skintight slow song with sister Sheila Berry was so evil that a bolt of lightning could have crashed through the roof of that dingy, oil-scented, black-lit ghetto garage. Ira Glass: Do you think that it's only possible to be heavily engaged in these issues, when you are young? Michael Warr: I think it's far more complicated because our sense of right and wrong is much bigger when we're kids. Michael Warr: I think that the environment I was coming up in, in which there was this metaphysical world that I was being force-fed every single day--Ira GlassThe Witnesses [INAUDIBLE]. Michael Warr--of my life. you have not formulated your own ideas about what is right, what is wrong. Michael Warr is the author ofWeAretheBlackBoy. supporting the Black Panthers in those days might have been considered a sin for a Jehovah's Witness. Eli was a big-time computer hacker. He and his friends were thrown into prison for this. In the mid-1980s, Eli was a member of a crew of computer hackers called MOD. They infiltrated dozens of business and government networks. Eli: \"What I did was a bad thing, and I don't suggest anybody else do it\" Eli served six months in a minimum-security prison and six months on home confinement. He says he was bummed out that he had to be home all day. \"It was like, where does this make sense?\" he says. It was more like a fame camp. People who were known and people who were involved in high-profile cases went there. They're doing me a favor by letting me out, yet I had more fun in there. Something's not right. The attitude there was that of camaraderie. Everybody there had this one thing in common, and that was that they looked for the shortest way possible to achieve what they wanted to achieve. And they all got there at some point. There were no losers there, that's for sure. Ira Glass: Eli was known by his handle, which was Acid Phreak. Glass: In prison, he got all sorts of job offers. Even the guards were telling the inmates, hey, that guy's in here for this. Eli's room is tiny, barely enough space for a bed, a desk, and a bookshelf. There's a TV and a VCR, two computers. On his CD player, there was old-school rap, Nine Inch Nails, the Doors. Eli: \"I have little sketches and diagrams of how things work, different protocols and networks, definitions\" \"I didn't do it to anybody. I just wanted to know how. We'd have a line of pay phones\" \"Liberating\" meaning make it so that you don't need quarters for that pay phone. Next step was to get into the network, find a session that was already going, and then knock them off while they were connected. In other words, put us in the place of the computer they were going to connect to. Next time they'd try to log in, they would get our computer. And we'd type in, \" login,\" and they'd put in their login account. We'd go into pay phones and stuff. And hooking up, I would drive up to a pay phone real quick and do what I had to do and leave really quick. That's where I really got into a collection. It's like baseball cards. You try to get the big names. \"Once you start going, you can't stop. You're just steamrolling one after the other,\" he says. \"The flow gets you going, and then you're just like, \"Yeah, we rule. We're it.\" It breaks down all barriers. Nothing can stop the flow\" They did actually call Julia Roberts once. They called Queen Elizabeth, too. Once you've got the Queen on the phone, what do you say?Eli: \"Hi, we're calling from the United States, and this and that\" Eli: \"What we did was such a small thing in such a larger scheme of things\" \"We could have monitored Peter Lynch. What's the next best investment for the day?\" \"We'd make millions of dollars investing or shorting some stock\" We'd make fun of him and laugh at him and call him Alfred E. Neuman. And then he got so mad at us. And we used to keep calling and screwing around with him. One day, we read in a paper he died. The day after we had called him, he passes away. Hacking on computers is so new that each person who does it feels like he or she can create his or her own moral code. Eli's crew had its own particular code of behavior. Unlike most hackers, they didn't share what they knew with other hackers. If I know something, and it's of importance to somebody else, who's to tell me I can't sell it if I know it? Like if I knew something about you that somebody would pay a price for, it's up to me and my own morality whether I would sell it to him or not. It's all a question of morality in my eyes. Ira Glass: Someone wrote a program that would automatically do it, scan all night and get thousands of credit cards. Glass: We're like, yeah, this is no good. What if they start selling credit cards and stuff? So we actually called the FBI and told them about it. Ira Glass: Eli was facing a daily question of right and wrong when it came to his own home confinement. Glass: The prison system was keeping track of him during home confinement with an electronic device. He says he hopes hacking will no longer be seen as a crime. Ira Glass says he was tired of hacking. He said he just didn't want to get in any more trouble. Glass: \"I just got to that point where everybody gets burnt out if they have a little too much of everything\" Eli: \"You have so much power and to lose it in an instant like that is just such a shock\" \"It's like, bam. You don't have that power anymore. You can't sit on your computer. What are you going to do?\" At the end of the bookAClockworkOrange, the central character gives up committing acts of violence. Acid Phreak was not the first criminal who told me that he quit being bad because he got bored with it. A few Chicago gang members have told me the same thing, that you end up having the same night over and over again. \"I knew what was happening, O my brothers. I was like growing up. Yes yes yes, there it is. Youth must go. Ah, yes. But youth is only being in a way like it might be an animal\" Ira Glass talks about his fantasy about having a son someday. \"I would like to explain all that to him, when he was starry enough to like understand\" \"And so it would itty on like that to the end of the world, like some bolshy, gigantic like chelloveck, like old Bog Himself\" Three boys, aged 13, 15, and 16, chose to appear with fake names on this radio program. The fake names they chose, you ready? K-Rad, Mr. Warez, and Fred. Those first two names come from the world of computer hacking and software piracy. K-Rad, Mr. Warez, and Fred were trying to be criminals. At a McDonald's on Times Square in New York City, they told all. They're actually in Manhattan for a computer hackers' convention this summer. They were not too successful at this. K-Rad, Mr. Warez, and Fred were involved in very low-level types of crimes. They pirated software. They scammed free CD-ROM games. They cheated one of the big online computer services out of a few hundred dollars in online time. Ira Glass: You can get a credit card number that you can use yourself. Glass: If you are thinking about doing this yourself, I should tell you not to. He says the idea behind the whole thing is to end up with a number that is not your own. K-rad: A good percentage of people don't understand what it means to have a restriction on your line. He says Fred himself was actually the victim of computer hackers twice. \"It doesn't work. You one important fact,\" K-rad says. K-Rad and Fred ordered $1,600 in computer merchandise on someone else's credit card. They had it delivered to a neutral address. They sold half of it for cash. K-Rad: \"I'm perfectly willing to let someone do that to me\" Fred believes that he has no choice. He really suffers over money. To get some cash, he actually sold the computer that his parents had bought for him. His idea is that he wanted to replace the computer as quickly as he could with the help of a stranger's credit card. K-rad: \"If I ever get the money so I don't have to do this shit anymore, then I'm not going to do it\" \"I give them $10 for no reason if I have the money because I feel bad about what I've stolen,\" he says. \"This is the biggest \"I'm really good inside\" K-Rad: I will repay everything I have ever done now. If I find myself making $2 million a year, I will send a $10,000 check to the company which I stole calling cards from. K-Rad told me that the $1,600 that they charged to a stranger's Visa card was a victimless crime. K-rad: I'd never beat someone up for money. Well, maybe I-- no, I wouldn't shoplift. Because that is hurting the individual person. Fred: \"I lose 10 pounds in one week. And that's not good for someone who's really skinny, like I am\" Fred: \"It's just a lot of fun. It's like you're doing stuff that is not exactly legal, not legal at all. And it's fun\" K-Rad: \"Real hackers do not use their skills like this. They don't do carding\" K-Rad: \"I'm actually starting, for the first time, to say this all out loud, everything I've done\" \"I've known that ever since I moved into doing maybe some credit card thing,\" he says. \"That's why I'm, in fact, even considering giving up on doing all the carding and stuff like that\" Fred says his worst fear is that he can end up going to hell for doing this. \"I want to get a gun and shoot you,\" he says to K-rad. \"It's always been my biggest fear. That's why I'm afraid of dying\" When is hell a possibility? Whenever you think it is, it is. More on this when our program continues. We told a Chicago playwright what K-Rad, Fred, and Mr. Warez told a playwright named Jeff Dorchen. Jeff Dorchen wrote an original radio play that would pick up the themes where the boys leave off. Warez said about hell and about sin and about their own relative badness in this world. So here's what he came up with. Caleb: I was born damned. I'm cowardly, petty, intolerant, lazy, and just generally destructive. Peter: Do you believe in sin? Caleb: Hell, no. I believe in damnation, though. Dondi: You can't have four. The most you can have is three. Dondi: \"At the center of the ninth and innermost frozen circle of hell, Lucifer devours Judas eternally\" Caleb: \"How many times do we have to go through this? It's like rolling a boulder up a hill just to have it roll back down again\" Peter: \"I'll see that and raise you one. One million lira\" Dondi: Gentlemen, the game is Chicago low. Ace, no face, sevens, follow the queen. All right, so there were a few too many wild cards. Let's hold the pot over. Peter?PeterHuh? Oh, sure. Leave it over. Caleb: You betrayed somebody and then didn't feel any remorse? Is that what all those pregnant pauses during the poker banter were about? Peter: Being afraid of punishment isn't the same as remorse. Remorse is truly feeling apologetic for what you've done. Dondi: What am I doing here? Who are these strange people? I don't remember deciding to come to Italy. Peter: I was in France, in Rouen, the town where Joan of Arc was burned at the stake. And I was thinking about writing a letter, you know, apologizing. Caleb: I'm starting to think that you don't really want to help yourself. Peter: Why are we playing poker in Italy with a demonic little boy whose grandmother is dying in the next room? Caleb: A peacock. Look, there it is, in the middle of the cemetery. \"The Golden Peacock\" was written forYourRadioPlayhouse by Jeff Dorchen. Peter Handler played Peter. Lisa Stodder played Dondi and played the dying grandmother. Michael Warr is a local poet and director of the Guild Complex. As a Jehovah's Witness, it was Armageddon or paradise. Michael Warr noticed that when there were black people in the pictures, that the sisters, their heads were always covered. And that was because there was a political issue that had not really been resolved. Michael Warr: In high school, these were serious issues. The natural was just like the Black Power sign. It was a political statement. So I said to myself, well, if the sisters can't wear afros in paradise, I don't want to be there. On the Oakland side of the bay, black 'hovahs broke all the rules. They danced, never really measuring the distance between their sacrilegious mounds. Was it the devil that made her move like that? Sunday morning, I asked my mother and don't remember her giving me an answer. Our sense of right and wrong is much bigger, our awareness of it, the internal debate about what is right and right, is much more acute when we're kids. I think that it's far more complicated because you have not formulated your own ideas. It's totally coming from outside of you. Michael Warr: I think that the environment I was coming up in, in which there was this metaphysical world that I was being force-fed every single day--Ira GlassThe Witnesses [INAUDIBLE]. Michael Warr--of my life. Michael Warr is the author ofWeAretheBlackBoy. Eli was a big-time computer hacker. He and his friends were thrown into prison for this. Eli served six months in the big house. He says he didn't feel guilty about it. In the mid-1980s, Eli was a member of a crew of computer hackers called MOD. They infiltrated dozens of business and government networks. Eli: \"What I did was a bad thing, and I don't suggest anybody else do it\" Eli served six months in a minimum-security prison and six months on home confinement. Eli: \"It actually bummed me out that I had to be home all day\" \"I had more fun in there. Something was not right\" It was more like a fame camp. People who were known and people who were involved in high-profile cases went there. My best friend there was a fellow by the name of Chris who lived out in San Diego and was involved in marijuana dealing. And he got caught. And they took away about $350,000 from him. The attitude there was that of camaraderie. Everybody there had this one thing in common, and that was that they looked for the shortest way possible to achieve what they wanted to achieve. And they all got there at some point. There were no losers there, that's for sure. Ira Glass: Eli was known by his handle, which was Acid Phreak. Glass: Inside, in prison, he got all sorts of job offers. It turns out that lots of people in prison can use the services of a computer hacker. Eli's room is tiny, barely enough space for a bed, a desk, and a bookshelf. There's a TV and a VCR, two computers. On his CD player, there was old-school rap, Nine Inch Nails, the Doors. Eli: These notes have basically all the systems I got into. Look, I have little sketches and diagrams of how things work, different protocols and networks, definitions. See, a lot of this stuff was really good. I had stuff outside the country, NASA. Next step was to get into the network, find a session that was already going, and then knock them off while they were connected. In other words, put us in the place of the computer they were going to connect to. So the next time they'd try to log in, they would get our computer. You get into things that are good. You start targeting systems that are interesting. Then you start developing a collection. It's like baseball cards. You try to get the big names. That's where I really got into a movie. I felt like it was likeMission:Impossible,like that whole gang. \"Once you start going, you can't stop. You're just steamrolling one after the other,\" Glass says. \"The flow gets you going, and then you're just like, \"Yeah, we rule. We're it.\" It breaks down all barriers,\" he adds. They did actually call Julia Roberts once. They called Queen Elizabeth, too. But there's an emptiness at the heart of a lot of these stories. Once you've got the Queen on the phone, what do you say?Eli was thrown into prison for a relatively minor offense. Eli: \"What we did was such a small thing in such a larger scheme of things\" \"We could have monitored Peter Lynch. What's the next best investment for the day?\" \"We'd make millions of dollars investing or shorting some stock\" We'd make fun of him and laugh at him and call him Alfred E. Neuman. And then he got so mad at us. And we used to keep calling and screwing around with him. One day, we read in a paper he died. The day after we had called him, he passes away. Eli: \"It's just a question of morality. If you want to shoot somebody's sister, somebody's right to make a living\" Ira Glass: \"Hacking on computers is so new that each person who does it feels like he or she can create his or her own moral code\" If I know something about you that somebody would pay a price for, it's up to me and my own morality whether I would sell it to him or not. It's all a question of morality in my eyes. If I think it's immoral, I'm not going to do it. But if for some reason I think that he's going to get it anyway, and it would benefit me, I'd probably give it to me anyway. Hackers were able to hack credit card numbers just by guessing. The group called the FBI and told them about it. It is because of their own moral code in their group, Ira Glass says. They believe that someday hacking will no longer be seen as a crime. Ira Glass visited Eli, who was in home confinement for hacking computers. Eli: \"I was a criminal in the sense that Jesus Christ was acriminal, you know?\" \"Who knows? Maybe one day, it'll be Acid Phreak, the faith. You never know\" Eli: \"I just got to that point where everybody gets burnt out if they have a little too much of everything\" \"It gets to be boring. I've just burned myself out, I think,\" he says. \"I usually get on the computer now, late at night\" It was sad. We would call each other up. And usually, we'd be talking about computers and trading passwords. And then my lifestyle started changing. I'd be sleeping at night again. So I was like, \"Damn. This is like-- I have to fill this void\" At the end of the bookAClockworkOrange, the central character gives up committing acts of violence. And it's not because he thinks it's wrong. He just gets tired of it. Ira Glass: Acid Phreak was not the first criminal who told me that he quit being bad because he got bored with it. He gives it up because he's bored with it. It's just not that interesting to him. And we will end our program today with a couple of paragraphs from the book. \"Being young is like being one of those malenky machines\" \"I would not be able to really stop him,\" says Ira Glass. \"And nor would he be can to stop his own son, brothers\" \"Like some bolshy, gigantic like chelloveck, like old Bog Himself, turning and turning and Turning\" The Blues Before Sunrise is a radio play by Ira Glass and Steve Cushing.

If you are able, we strongly encourage you to listen to the audio, which includes emotion and emphasis that's not on the page. Transcripts are generated using a combination of speech recognition software and human transcribers. Ira Glass: We are in the interregnum of poultry. This is the peak poultry moment in our American year. We bring you an odd variety of stories and things you not would hear elsewhere. A Chicago poet actually named Jim Banks suggested a special name for this special poultry edition. Ira Glass: In the late 1960s, the winged warrior Chickenman struck terror in the hearts of evildoers everywhere. Glass: Tonight, we're going to bring you a historic first, the first new episode since 1969, later. Danielle Fish, 28, is editor atDetailsmagazine in New York City. Her sister, Ashley, two years younger, now a graduate student at the University of Michigan. Duki has been in the family since they were children. Danielle always got her way, except when Duki was around. Duki would insult and tease Danielle and give her painful nose squeaks. I was just putty in Duki's hands. Ashley's very considerate and kind and thoughtful, and very, very sensitive. Ira Glass 18 years after Duki arrived in the Mattoon household, I can say, I think fairly accurately, that the fluffy whiteness is long gone. \"Fluffy\" is not a word-- you would never use that word with Duki anymore. Ira Glass has been at Danielle's house sometimes and witnessed the following scene. Danielle has not spoken with her sister in weeks, picks up the phone, calls her sister Ashley in Michigan. Ashley essentially becomes Duki, puts Duki on the line. And then they both hang up. Danielle: \"He takes up as much room in my heart as a lot of people individually\" \"If something happened to him, if he were lost at an airport or run over by a car, it would really be heartbreaking\" \"He's in denial about most things. He's totally weak and tiny and dirty\" Ira Glass tried to book Duki to come on the radio for this show. The only way that I can reach him is by calling your mom and speaking to Yona Lu. I think she's acting as his agent. She's a hedgehog. Mrs. Mattoon: I want to do a little story on the radio about Duki.Ira Glass: I contacted your daughter, Ashley. And she said that for me to book Duki on to my radio show, I was going to first need to contact Yona Lu. Mrs. Mattoon: In Danielle's family-- I guess you're figuring this out. There's Duki, there's Yona Lu. And then there are four or five other characters, Therese-- I can never keep all their names straight-- who live in this world. Danielle and Ashley Mattoon have an imaginary friend called Guy Frank. Guy Frank is Duki's imaginary friend. Duki is such a fully realized imaginary friend that he has his own imaginary friend, too. Danielle's father, for example, was never too keen on it. Danielle and Ashley Mattoon had two daughters that only communicated through a duck. If Ashley wanted to get Danielle's attention all she had to do was rev up the duck. Danielle thought Duki was very funny, but I can't remember her thinking Ashley was funny. Ira Glass finally snag an interview with Duki by calling Ashley. He just got back from a party, though. He was at a happy hour thing with a lot of college students. It definitely gives me this vision into her brain that I wouldn't have otherwise. Duki: When I was younger, in order to discipline her, if she was doing something that you didn't like, you could pretty much control her with something called \"nose squeaks\" Like over Thanksgiving, we were watchingTheMuppetShow,and Miss Piggy was on. And she reminded me a lot of Nielly. Duki: I'm kind of an unusual duck. I'm not really in touch with the whole duck scene. I just wanted more in my life than that. I've just started spending more time with people. And I just don't have time to do those duck things anymore. Chickenman first soared the radio airwaves from 1966 to 1969. Nearly every day, there would be a new episode for three years. It is still on the air, they say, in several dozen markets. It will probably continue years after we are gone. Chickenman was written especially for our broadcast by Dick Orkin, the voice of Chickenman. How did it come about that Benton Harbor, weekend winged warrior, selected the visage of the chicken in his crusade against the forces of evil? Now it can be told. Benton Harbor: I wonder if you would permit me to conduct a quick experiment outside this store. Woman: Why not try it on? Man: Well, how did it go? Woman: A Teddy bear and a chicken. Be listening tomorrow for another episode. Julie Showalter grew up on a turkey farm in southwest Missouri. Turkeys spend their first 16 weeks in a heated brooder house. When they are 16 weeks old, they are put outside to range in fenced enclosures. The day before the night that 3,000 turkeys died, we moved 13,000Turkeys to the range. By the time the turkeys have been in a brooder house for 16 weeks, the air is filled with ammonia, feather particles, and dust. Tiny barbed pieces of feather dig into the tissue of your lung and never let go. You can contract disabling lung diseases from working only a week in a poultry house. These turkeys didn't want to go into the sun. As we pushed from behind, they compacted. It was like an old adventure movie where the walls are closing in. But there was no wall at the end, only a patch of sunlight which turkeys would not touch. We didn't own the turkeys. We raised them for a company that owned the hatchery, the feed mill, the fleet of trucks. We got a portion of the profits, if there were profits. If we weren't paid for this flock, we would have no cash coming in until the next flock was raised. As she lay on the ground, shaking and holding her stomach, I hated her for being the one too sick to continue. But even she was not too sick. She got an extra five minutes to rest, but we all went on. \"I couldn't afford n------,\" he told my sister Billie. \"So I had daughters.\" At midnight, Mother woke us up. \"We have to get to the pen. Daddy needs us.\" We ran out in the driving rain. Flashes of lightning showed Daddy picking up turkeys and throwing them, one after the other. That's the day we had before the night 3,000 turkeys died. Julie Showalter lives in Burr Ridge, Illinois, and says that she still does eat turkey. Luis Rodriguez: \"You don't know if the ones you are throwing are dead or alive. You don't care. Maybe we saved some\" The rooster had no sense of time, nor any desire to commit to one. He'd cock-a-doodle whenever he had the notion. The rooster lived with three dogs, a German Shepherd and two mutts. The dogs barked through their existence. The rooster often ran alongside the dogs as they raced across the dirt yard. If the dogs went left, the rooster went left. They'd go right, and dang if that rooster didn't go right as well. I don't know if this is a regular condition for roosters. A new neighbor, a young lady, who often drank herself to bliss, got a gun and blew the rooster away. She became somewhat of a local hero. But I suppose one can tolerate barking dogs. But barking roosters? That's another matter altogether. Miss Helfinger: I'm ready for test sequence number one. Police Commissioner: The chicken missile is ready to go. Miss Helfinger, have the commissioner stand by with the chicken missile receiver. We'll see you at 1400 hours. Chickenman Announcer: Say, that chicken missile really works nifty. Will the Midland City Fire Department recommend that a chicken missile receiver be installed in what's left of Midland city Hall? Be listening tomorrow for another exciting episode in the life of the most fantastic crimefighter the world has ever known. Verta, Vertamae Grosvenor, is a National Public Radio commentator, host of an NPR show calledSeasonings. Back in 1970, she published a cookbook. She was interviewed about it on television by Barbara Walters. Verta says that's always people's reaction. Ira Glass: Can you tell that the chicken is done without any visual cues? Can it be done purely, purely on the basis of sound?Vertamae Grosvenor: I would say that's something like the middle. Ms. Vertamae Grosvenor can get close to telling when chicken is done, but can't be totally sure of it. In short, this was a chicken-watching exercise. The answer is number two, which means that using only the sound of the chicken, Ms.Vertamae could tell when chicken was done. Vertamae Grosvenor: \"Listen to the sound of the chicken.\"[LAUGHTER] \"Everything that she cooks is golden brown and perfect, perfect,perfect\" \"But just because we're her daughters, that doesn't mean that she tells us the real recipes\" Ira Glass: You don't tell them all the ingredients.Vertamae Grosvenor: I just tell them, but then they have to find out the rest for themselves. Chicken is craftier than we usually give it credit for, Glass says. Vertamae Grosvenor: The chicken and the rooster had a fight. Sedaris: I had one of those experiences that remind me why I shop in the first place. The newChickenmanepisode, the first one since 1969, is coming. Bob Greene saw a taxidermied turkey's head attached to its own foot at a flea market. Greene: Why would you do that? Or more importantly, what sort of life would you lead that might enable you to make this connection? Greene: I was hypnotized by this object. I stared into the face of this taxidermied turkey's head, and nothing else mattered. I handed over my wallet in a trance, just gave it to her, thinking she could take the whole thing. \"All right. $85. $120. $370,\" she said. Dick Orkin, the voice of Chickenman and the brains behindChickenman. This is the style that launched 1,000 imitators. \"There was just something offbeat. You couldn't even quite put your finger on what it was,\" Orkin says. This is the first new Chickenmanepisode written since 1969. It's the first full episode written by Chickenman since 1969, and the first in 30 years. Chickenman is getting up in years, and no one appears to be more aware of that than his creator. Cholesterol high? I had no idea. The pain in your toes is arthritis. And I think you have the beginning of a nice hernia. Your good cholesterol is not good. But in time, your bad cholesterol will be good, and your good cholesterol will also be bad. Dupont Chopper returns to the Chicken Cave to confront his mortality. After all, he's been fighting crime and/or evil for over 30 years, pursuing it down streets and allies and sewers and other picturesque places. \"I ask myself why it never stared me in the face before,\" he says. Police Commissioner: If I make the sky blue in this picture and the mountains brown, do you think the rocks should be chartreuse? Police Commissioner: Well, that would mean that you'd have to-- and of course one can't even be sure that that. Benton Harbor has a lot of light job openings. One of them is a napkin- folder in a nouveau Italian-Chinese restaurant specializing in pizza and light salads. Another is a negligee model in a delicatessen. Benton Harbor is a small, desert, superhero retirement community. \"Fishwoman\" and \"Flying Newt\" love it. \"I can't sleep, and I sip warm milk in the Chicken Cave\" \"I stand on the roof of Midland City's tallest skyscraper, four dizzy stories high\" This is the winged warrior, fates. I shall go on fighting crime and/or evil. I don't care that my bad cholesterol is bad. Phyllis, Fran and Fred are in Las Vegas. God bless them, they should only win and be well. \"Chickenman Challenges a Fate Named Frank\" was recorded at Dick Orkin's radio ranch in Hollywood, California. The cast included Charlie Brill, Allison Anne Martin, Miriam Flynn, and Jim Gallant. Be listening tomorrow for another exciting episode in the life of the most fantastic crimefighter the world has ever known. In Danielle's family, when dinner comes, sometimes they serve a meal that might look familiar to you. See you next week, same chicken time and same chicken channel. Our address, 848 East Grand Avenue, Navy Pier, Chicago, 60611. Our email address, oh why don't you write us,[email protected]. That's[email protected] We are in the interregnum of poultry. This is the peak poultry moment in our American year. We bring you this evening an odd variety of stories and things you not would hear elsewhere-- just transpose the words of that sentence yourselves at home. Ira Glass suggested a special name for this special poultry edition of thisYourRadioPlayhouse. His suggestion, \"A Poultry Slam,\" after, of course, the poetry slams the we hold here in Chicago. Coming up this hour, David Sedaris, Luis Rodriguez, and other writers and radio heroes. DanielleFish is an editor atDetailsmagazine in New York City. Her sister Ashley is a graduate student at the University of Michigan. Duki has been in the family since they were children. He was a Christmas present when Ashley was about eight and I was about 10. As children, Danielle pretty much would dominate Ashley. Danielle always got her way, except when Duki was around. Duki would insult and tease Danielle and give her painful nose squeaks. then he became Ashley's vehicle for torturing me. Ira Glass: Duki Mattoon is simultaneously a braggart and a total wimp. He's boastful and vain. He has this total \"What's for lunch?\" attitude. He couldn't come home for Thanksgiving because he had to go be at practice. Danielle has not spoken with her sister in weeks, picks up the phone, calls her sister Ashley in Michigan. Ashley essentially becomes Duki, puts Duki on the line. Danielle talks to Duki for 15, 20 minutes and then they both hang up. Danielle: It really makes me sad to think about a world without Duki. He takes up as much room in my heart as a lot of people individually. If something happened to him, if he were lost at an airport or run over by a car, it would really be heartbreaking. He's in denial about the fact that he's actually stuffed, which he is. he's really smart and has a lot of friends. I say, \"Duki, give me a break. You're just stuffed.\" And he's like, \"No way\" Mrs. Mattoon: I want to book Duki on my radio show. I was told to contact Yona Lu in order to get in touch with her. She's basically taken charge of Duki's financial affairs. Mrs. Mattoons: What do I do next? Mrs. Mattoon: I'll just talk to Yona Lu about it. She says OK, it's OK. I think she'd want to be on, too, if it were TV. She doesn't talk, so radio doesn't do much for her. Danielle and Ashley have an imaginary friend called Guy Frank. Guy Frank is Duki's imaginary friend. Duki is such a fully realized imaginary friend that he has his own imaginary friend, Therese. Therese lives in a world that's fleshed out with a lot of vivid detail and drama. For a while there, we had two daughters that only communicated through a duck. If Ashley wanted to get Danielle's attention all she had to do was rev up the duck. Danielle thought Duki was very funny, but I can't remember her thinking Ashley was funny. Danielle: \"It definitely gives me this vision into her brain that I wouldn't have otherwise\" Danielle: \"I think kind of a big chunk. of it is based on my relationship with Duki\" Duki: \"Hey, Ira, how you doing?\" Duki: I was talking to Danielle for our radio program and had her come on and talk about you a little bit. And one of the things that she said was that in order to discipline her, if she was doing something that you didn't like, you could pretty much control her with something called \"nose squeaks\" Duki: \"I'm kind of an unusual duck. I'm not really in touch with the whole duck scene\" \"I've just started spending more time with people and doing my own thing,\" he says. \"I just don't have time to do those duck things anymore\" Chickenman first soared the radio airwaves from 1966 to 1969. Nearly every day, there would be a new episode for three years. It is still on the air, they say, in several dozen markets, making it one of the longest-running radio features anywhere. First newChickenmanepisode since 1969. Written especially for our broadcast by Dick Orkin, the voice of Chickenman. How did it come about that Benton Harbor, weekend winged warrior, selected the visage of the chicken in his crusade against the forces of evil? Benton Harbor asks a woman to try on his costume. She tries it on and says it's not bad. He then asks her to kiss him. She says she looks like an adorable bunny rabbit. He kisses her and she says it was a success. Julie Showalter grew up on a turkey farm in southwest Missouri. Turkeys spend their first 16 weeks in a heated brooder house. When they are 16 weeks old, they are put outside to range in fenced enclosures. We made a temporary chute of wire fencing that ran from the brooder to the range. By the time the turkeys have been in a brooder house for 16 weeks, the air is filled with ammonia, feather particles, and dust. After an hour in the brooding house, your lungs hurt for a day. Tiny barbed pieces of feather dig into the tissue of your lung and never let go. These turkeys didn't want to go into the sun. As we pushed from behind, they compacted. It was like an old adventure movie where the walls are closing in. But there was no wall at the end, only a patch of sunlight which turkeys would not touch. We didn't own the turkeys. We raised them for a company that owned the hatchery, the feed mill, the fleet of trucks. We got a portion of the profits, if there were profits. If we weren't paid for this flock, we would have no cash coming in until the next flock was raised. \"I couldn't afford n------,\" he told my sister Billie. \"So I had daughters\" \"I hated her for being the one too sick to continue,\" she says. \"Even she was not too sick. We all went on\" At midnight, Mother woke us up. \"We have to get to the pen. Daddy needs us.\" We ran out in the driving rain. Flashes of lightning showed Daddy picking up turkeys and throwing them. They die because they are scared, and they huddle together in their fear. And they suffocate. Julie Showalter lives in Burr Ridge, Illinois, and says that she still does eat turkey. Well, twice a year, she eats it. And this is the special Poultry Slam edition. Ira Glass: If there wasn't someone to pull them off each other, 50 could die because someone slammed a door. Luis Rodriguez: \"The Rooster Who Thought it Was a Dog\" \"Shut up, or I'll blow your stinking brains out,\" I'd yell at the rooster. With calm aplomb, it continued to squawk. It happened that the rooster lived with three dogs, a German Shepherd and two mutts. The dogs barked through their existence. I finally concluded that rooster thought it was a dog. Somehow, I didn't mind the dogs barking. But when a rooster barks, that's murder. A new neighbor, a young lady, who often drank herself to bliss, got a gun and blew the rooster away. I must say, though, it was an unfitting end for the bird. But I suppose one can tolerate barking dogs. But barking roosters? That's another matter altogether. Miss Helfinger: \"I'm now all set for test sequence number one\" \"The chicken missile is ready to go,\" she says. \"The commissioner said that's very nice,\" says Benton Harbor. \"In that case, Miss Helfinger, have the commissioner stand by with the commissioner,\" he says. Miss Helfinger: I would suggest that you crouch under your desk. Chickenman Announcer: Say, that chicken missile really works nifty. Will the Midland City Fire Department recommend that a chicken missile receiver be installed in what's left of midland City Hall? Verta, Vertamae Grosvenor, is a National Public Radio commentator, host of an NPR show calledSeasonings. Back in 1970, she published a cookbook. And she was interviewed about it on television by Barbara Walters. Vertamae Grosvenor: I've been claiming for years that you can tell if the chicken's done purely by the sound. Ira Glass: To determine if that's true, we've decided to conduct a little radio experiment. We're going to play you four different moments in the frying of the chicken. Vertamae Grosvenor: Number two is toward the end, too. Number three is more toward the beginning. Number four is an ender. It's in the three fourths part. And the answer is number two, which means. Ms. Vertamae Grosvenor can get close to telling when chicken is done, but can't be totally sure of it. \"You have to see it. Do you know what I mean?Ira GlassYeah. You've got to stay on it,\" she says. Vertamae Grosvenor: \"Just because we're her daughters, that doesn't mean that she tells us the real recipes\" Chandra: \"I was completely convinced that you were just going to snap and get it, and it was going to be really easy\" Vertamae Grosvenor: Chicken is craftier than we usually give it credit for. The chicken and the rooster had a fight. Rooster told the chicken, \"That's alright. Meet you in the gumbo tomorrow night\" Ira Glass: Did we mention the newChickenmanepisode, the first one since 1969? Bob Greene saw a taxidermied turkey's head attached to its own foot at a flea market. Greene: Why would you do that? Or more importantly, what sort of life would you lead that might enable you to make this connection? Greene: I was hypnotized by this object. David Sedaris: I handed over my wallet in a trance, just gave it to her. \"All right,\" she said, \"$35. $30.\" But she could have gone up. $85. $120. $370, Sedaris says. Dick Orkin, the voice of Chickenman and the brains behindChickenman. This is the style that launched 1,000 imitators. Ira Glass: You could always tell. That's the guy. Those are [UNINTELLIGIBLE]. This is the first new Chickenmanepisode written since 1969. It's the first full episode written by Chickenman's creator. The episode is called \"Chickenman: Man 1,\" and it airs Tuesday at 9 p.m. ET on RadioPlayhouse. Cholesterol high? I had no idea. The pain in your toes is arthritis. And I think you have the beginning of a nice hernia. Your good cholesterol is not good. But in time, your bad cholesterol will be good, and your good cholesterol will not be good. Dupont Chopper has been fighting crime and/or evil for over 30 years. \"I ask myself why it never stared me in the face before,\" he says. \"Well, don't look at small children or animals,\" he adds. \"That's the health story\" 4:00 PM. I go to the local office of the Grace Hill Ferguson Employment Agency and Screen Door Company. If I make the sky blue in this picture and the mountains brown, do you think the rocks should be chartreuse?Benton HarborPerfect. Benton Harbor is looking for someone to work on Wednesday morning. Do you know Windows 95? Do you have any special equipment, office or otherwise, are you experienced in using? Could you spell \"Geshtukna ray gun\"? Chicken Alarm goes off a half hour late for my geriatric counseling appointment. Tire still flat. So I take the convenient number 18 bus. And that leaves me off only 28 blocks from the counselor's office.Counselor: Get out. This is the winged warrior, fates. I shall go on fighting crime and/or evil. Phyllis, Fran and Fred are in Las Vegas. God bless them, they should only win and be well. Watch the fatty foods, the cookies, the ice cream, and good luck to you. \"Chickenman Challenges a Fate Named Frank\" was recorded at Dick Orkin's radio ranch in Hollywood, California. The show is produced by Dolores Wilber, Nancy Updike, Peter Clowney, Alix Spiegel and myself. Danielle: I just want a real person who's like Duki, probably. Margi Rochlin, Paul Tough, and Jack Hitt provided music for the show. The Mattoon family, Ashley, Lynn, Duki and Yona Lu contributed to this program.\n",

Ira Glass and Sandra Tsing Loh and David Sedaris tackle that team. Today's program, Nightmare Vacations, includes stories by Sandra Loh. My parents brought their favorite breakfast cereals with them, 10,000 miles to Hawaii. They like the familiar comforts of home, like many people do. In all sorts of stressful situations, what my parents do is that they make themselves comfortable by creating a comfortable, personal space. When my mom got breast cancer five years ago, they decided to start a major rehab on the house. And in Hawaii, with the stress of having to deal with the children and the grandchildren, they spent a lot of time obsessing on the condo. The sliding glass doors weren't the heavy, nice kind, my mom thought. It turned out that none of the things that you would expect that people would actually want to do in Hawaii were things that my parents, especially, were willing to do. My sisters and I, we couldn't even talk them into staying up late and playing cards with us. The activities offered by Hawaii seem so puny in comparison to the mountain. Sandra Tsing Loh: For some people, a vacation in paradise is paradise. But for others of us, it's much more difficult. Loh's mother planned a family summer vacation to Ethiopia in 1969. She says her mother was an optimist. Sandra Tsing Loh: My mother stood 5'11\", a fast-talking German brunette. \"Peach schnapps, it is the most elegant drink,\" she used to tell us girls. composer. She's a columnist forBuzzMagazinein Los Angeles. My father never took to the idea of spending money for the sole purpose of fun. Vacations, birthdays, swimming lessons, Christmas-- these were concepts that didn't really work for him. \"Oh, no. Spend, spend, spend. That's just all I do\" When my mother first saw my father in the mid '50s, he was sitting behind the wheel of a shiny new '56 Buick. My father was orphaned by age 12 in Shanghai, lived in poverty. My mother went through World War II, ran from soldiers. My mother would make a glass of peach schnapps and a singalong of some kind. When American friends at dinner parties asked her about hardship in Danzig, World War II, Polish occupation, she'd cut them off at the path. \"But enough of me. We are all of us travelers, nicht wahr?\" In 1969, after many disagreements, she had learned to be crafty. She dropped the idea of Hawaii or Florida or Disneyland. All she was suggesting was a four-day trip to Massawa, Pearl of the Red Sea. It was the last adventure my parents would ever agree on. \"We will run away from your father and swim on the beach\" was the kind of word my mother would use to describe anything that was too wonderful to be possible and therefore would never come to pass. \"Lalibella\" was a town with a suspiciously gay name. Air Ethiopia was not a good airline. The hotel Lalibella seemed made entirely of peat, and peat which had taken its kicks and beatings from the desert wind for a long time. Thick woven carpets with ominous symbols hung everywhere, exuding a faint hay smell. Kaitlin and I were given sour glasses of lemonade to drink as we perched on the family suitcases. By incredible coincidence, Ilsa, Franz-Joseph, and the fat couple were headed too to Massawa, Pearl of the Red Sea. So they all originally hailed from my mother's hometown. It would be a party. Maybe Kaitlin and I would even get to swim on the beach. \"Du ferrukten Deutschen,\" my father guffawed in his terrible German, reaching over and goosing Ilsa on the rear. I think the Germans were amused by my Chinese father, as though he were a small attack dog. The bus is the one place where adventure and economy meet in Ethiopia. \"The scenery is absolutely stunning. You will miss it all by plane. Everyone takes the bus. It is what is done. the natives go. It's sehr gemutlich,\" she says. The family is assigned to the first bus. Our seats are right over the wheel. The floor rises in a hump under our feet. And, as I've told you, my mother is 5'11\". But the bus officials seem oddly opposed to us changing our seats. Why? The first bus is full, and for some odd reason, they do not want to put us on the second. \"But we cannot sit there. We cannot. Mein Gott! It is intolerable. We are not animals.\" \"I will go to the American consulate.\" Eritrean terrorists clad in military fatigues fire machine guns randomly into the air. Ahead of us, an Ethiopian peasant woman's cheap black purse is cut from her arm. All around us is the blankness of the Eritrean desert. The great blue depth is mesmerizing, oddly peaceful. It gradually dawns on us that the terrorists' real interest is in the first bus, not the second. 50 yards up the road, Ilsa, Franz-Joseph, and the fat couple have become the center of attention. They stand helplessly in their sumptuous safari outfits, hands in the air. \"The bus company set it all up. It was totally corrupt. They put all the foreigners on the first bus to make it easy,\" he says. \"Who needed to see the Pearl of the Red Sea anyway? Not us. That night we dined on hot dogs und chocolate milk at the American military base\" The Ethiopian vacation becomes the story of her marriage, a compromise between two opposites that can never be made to work. Eventually my parents spend all their time alone screaming and fighting. And then they stop talking at all, live together in silence, two strangers under one roof. Sandra Tsing Loh's story represents a kind of a limit case, the ultimate scenario of a nightmare family vacation. David Sedaris has a story about awakening to all the possibilities of just hitting the road alone. In a minute, when our program continues, we'll talk about David Sedari's story. Sedaris: I had seen the original movie nine times, waiting always for Charlton Heston's heartfelt, \"Damn you! Damn you all to hell!\" when he discovers he's been on his home planet. I thought of calling for a ride, but my mother was off enduring my older sister's flute recital. That left my father, and he was out of the question. I left the theater and held out my thumb. It was just that easy. My father was in the habit of picking up hitchhikers. We would be packed into the station wagon on our way to the pool or the grocery store. He would pull over, instructing us to make room for company. I noticed that my father only stopped for young people. We would spot some stooped and weathered man standing beside a beat-up suitcase and call out for my father to stop. \"Dad, look,\" he drove right on by as if they were painted cutouts advertising a restaurant named Tramp's or Hobo's. I started hitchhiking on a regular basis. Aside from the convenience, I liked the fact that these people didn't know anything about me. I could reinvent myself every time I opened a car door, trying on whichever personality happened to suit my mood. There were black ministers and retired locksmiths, I never hitchhiked beyond the city limits until I was sent off to college and met a girl named Ronnie. Her mother had died in the living room while confined to an iron lung, and her father had remarried twice within the last four years. Ronnie was tough and independent in a way I'd never known. I'd never hitchhiked that far, much less alone. Allowing fear to get the best of me, I made the mistake of teaming up with Dale Knowles. Dale was creating his own major in beat literature. His laugh was prolonged and phlegmy, like a cat tossing up a hairball. We were picked up by two young men in a Jeep who introduced themselves as Starsky and Hutch. They were wired and loopy, washing down over-the-counter amphetamines with quarts of malt liquor. When asked where they were from, Starsky made a gagging gesture. \"Do you have a taste for it? Well, I do. Run on into the store there and see if they have some,\" Starsky says. The attendant headed our way, a roll of bills in his hand, ready to accept payment. He reached the bumper just as Starsky peeled out of the station. Starsky and Hutch seemed to enjoy our pathetic displays of fear, jiggling the steering wheel and cutting off other drivers. \"What about the police?\" Starsky said. \"Police? Hey, ho, buddy, we can outrun the damn police, no problem.\" Dale used the downtime as an opportunity to compose a few new songs. The day after I walked in on him standing naked before a full length mirror singing [SINGING] \"San Francisco, you stole my heart. California's stirring in my blood\" CNN's John Sutter traveled across the U.S. with a female companion. The pair slept in abandoned houses and open fields, under bridges and behind barbed-wire fences. Sutter: \"We got rides with single women and truck drivers who claimed they needed company\" \"You, my young friend, are going to wash my car inside and out, and you're going to pay for it\" \"I give and give to all of Uncle Sam's little takers. And I've been thinking that maybe it's about time I get a little something in return\" I got a ride back to the interstate and another that landed me 20 miles beyond Charleston, West Virginia. It was around 4 o'clock, and I hoped I might catch a long ride that would take me through to Ohio. I waited 10 minutes before someone slowed down and stopped 20 yards up the road. The man's shirt introduced him as T.W. The writer was hitchhiking to Ohio to study medicine. He made a bet with a friend that he could get from Duke to Kent State in 18 hours. \"Look at me,\" he said, brushing the candy wrappers onto the floor, \"riding with a brain doctor\" He drove off the interstate and onto a series of highways and country roads before stopping at a tavern. It was a cinder block building lit with signs advertising brands of beer and the existence of a pool table. He asks would I like to come in, but I was under age and had not yet developed a thirst for alcohol. T.W. staggered out of the bar at around 10 o'clock. He had his arms around a skinny, long-faced man and obese woman who held her pocketbook over her head in protection against the rain. He waved goodbye to the man and woman and proceeded to start the engine, jabbing the key here and there. \"Those are my friends,\" he said. \"I've been knowing them all my life, and they're fun people. You got that?\" His face had lost that innocent quality and become stern and dogmatic. He repeated the word several times, pounding his chest with his fist. I was looking out at the wet road and didn't see it coming. He grabbed me by the hair and yanked my head down onto the seat. The gun felt just the way I always knew it would. He held it against the side of my face, the barrel butting against my jaw. \"I thought I should climb a tree, but that's what you do for bears. No, bears will climb after you, small bears, won't they? But he's not a bear. But still, I can't climb with socks on my hands\" I thought to get up and run, but he was too close now. He'll only shoot me down or shoot me now in the back maybe. What I needed was a gun or a knife. The Indians made knives and spears. But how did they do it? It took days probably, maybe even weeks. I ran down the exit ramp and into the middle of the interstate, waving my arms and begging someone to stop. The first two cars just missed hitting me, but the third pulled over. He rolled down the window and drove off slowly, the door ajar and the cab lights on. \"I had always counted upon people to trust me, but now I no longer quite trusted them,\" he says. \"When I though of sex, I pictured someone standing before me crying, \"I love you so much that I don't even know who I am anymore.\" He was no particular age or race. All that mattered is that he was crazy about me\" The author hitchhiked from Atlanta to Fayetteville, North Carolina. He says he was threatened by a married couple, a middle-aged man and woman driving a Cadillac nude. He moved to Chicago and then New York, which is even better, he says. David Sedaris: Every time you turn on the public radio, it's the Ozark Mountain Daredevils. Sedaris is the author ofBarrelFeverand the forthcoming bookNaked. If you would like a copy of this radio program, it is only $10. ThisAmericanLife chooses a theme and invites a variety of writers and performers to tackle that team. Today's program, Nightmare Vacations, includes stories by Sandra Tsing Loh and David Sedaris. Back next week with more stories of ThisAmericanLife.,Act One: Act One. Ira Glass went to Hawaii with his family to spend time with his parents. He says he wanted to get along with them, which, in his family, as in many, is not so easy. Glass: If an American family can't get along in paradise, what hope is there? My parents like the familiar comforts of home, like many people do. When my mom got breast cancer five years ago, they decided to start a major rehab on the house. In all sorts of stressful situations, what my parents do is that they make themselves comfortable by focusing on creating a comfortable, personal space. \"My mom would vanish for hours at the time. She would have been out, checking out other condos and hotel accommodations,\" she says. \"It turned out that none of the things that you would expect that people would actually want\" were what they wanted. The activities offered by Hawaii seem so puny in comparison to the mountain that the average family presents. My parents don't snorkel or swim. They don't like the ocean or the sun. My sisters and I couldn't even talk them into staying up late and playing cards with us. Sandra Tsing Loh is a writer, performer, and composer. She's a columnist forBuzzMagazinein Los Angeles. This story is from her one-woman showAliensinAmerica,which is largely about her ideas about how to get close to paradise. Sandra Tsing Loh's mother was a fast-talking German brunette. \"Peach schnapps, it is the most elegant drink,\" she used to tell us girls. \"Your mother's dance card was saw from empty in those days,\" she says. My father never took to the idea of spending money for the sole purpose of fun. \"It is not that I do not like to spend money,\" he'd say. \"Oh, no. Spend, spend, spend. That's just all I do\" When my mother first saw my father in the mid '50s, he was sitting behind the wheel of a shiny new '56 Buick. My father was orphaned by age 12 in Shanghai, lived in poverty. My mother went through World War II, ran from soldiers, heard bombs drop. \"We are all of us travelers, nicht wahr? Foreign people in a foreign land. Let us sing\" \"It's a small world after all,\" my mother would say. \"Edelweiss, you look happy to see me\" My father suggested a four-day trip to Massawa, Pearl of the Red Sea. Ethiopia was notoriously backward, wretched poor. No one in the world would want to go on vacation in Ethiopia. \"After all,\" my father asked, \"if no one else is going, think how far the American dollar will go\" Air Ethiopia was not a good airline. A plunging, four-hour ride on a shuttering gray plane brought us to a town with a suspiciously gay name of Lalibella. \"Lalibella!\" my mother exclaimed in mock dismay as its airport, a manure field, rose up to meet us. Kaitlin's mother and four German tourists were visiting the country. The family were given sour glasses of lemonade to drink as they watched sheep graze outside a big picture window. All at once, the sheep screamed and scattered. A man in a galabia was running after them with an ax. By incredible coincidence, Ilsa, Franz-Joseph, and the fat couple were headed too to Massawa, Pearl of the Red Sea. So they all originally hailed from my mother's hometown. Maybe Kaitlin and I would even get to swim on the beach. The Deutschen were indeed headed to Massawa, but they were planning to fly. My father, of course, had just gotten tickets for the bus. \"Besides,\" he insisted, \"we are not stupid tourists. We will go the way the natives go\" The scenery is absolutely stunning. You will miss it all by plane. Everyone takes the bus. It is what is done. Perhaps a bit rustic, but sehr gemutlich in its own way. It's the one place where adventure and economy meet. There are two buses heading out towards Massawa this day. We and the Germans are all assigned to the first bus. Our seats are right over the wheel. The floor rises in a hump under our feet. We can't stretch our legs out. For nine hours. \"It is intolerable. Mein Gott! We are not animals,\" she says. \"I will go to the American consulate.\" Bingo. Without a word, three of us are moved to the second bus, far from anyone we know. The buses navigate their way down treacherous mountains. The twin forces of adventure and economy have brought us to Eritrean terrorists firing machine guns randomly into the air. Ahead of us, an Ethiopian peasant woman's cheap black purse is cut from her arm. \"So, this is it,\" I think, \"the end of my life, right here.\" It gradually dawns on us that the terrorists' real interest is in the first bus, not the second. 50 yards up the road, Ilsa, Franz-Joseph, and the fat couple have become the center of attention. And I realize in that moment with a kind of savvy world traveler's instinct that my father will not be shot that day. The Deutschen friends were released two weeks later, but their passports, cameras, traveler's checks, never got back. \"It was totally corrupt. They put all the foreigners on the first bus to make it easy,\" he says. \"Who needed to see the Pearl of the Red Sea anyway?\" When my mother first saw it on that magical day in the '50s, it was the car of a true American. But that Buick would turn out to be an anomaly in my father's life, a youthful extravagance. As the years went by, it would make my father sick for anyone even to drive it, to waste money on gas. Sandra Tsing Loh is the author of the book depthTakesaHoliday. David Sedaris has a story about awakening to all the possibilities of just hitting the road alone. In a minute, when our program continues, we'll hear about David's travels without his family. I had seen the original movie nine times, waiting always for Vera to ask, \"What will he find out there in the forbidden zone, Dr. Zaius?\" Charlton Heston's heartfelt, \"Damn you! Damn you all to hell!\" when he discovers he's been on his home planet throughout the course of the entire movie. My father was in the habit of picking up hitchhikers. It was exciting to have a stranger in the car. My father, his cocktail tinkling between his thighs, was always gracious but at the same time suspicious. \"OK, Rudy, I'll be happy to take you to your grandmother's house\" I noticed my father only stopped for young people. We would spot some stooped and weathered man standing beside a beat-up suitcase and call out for my father to stop. \"Dad, look,\" he drove right on by as if they were painted cutouts advertising a restaurant. I started hitchhiking on a regular basis. Aside from the convenience, I liked the fact that these people didn't know anything about me. I could reinvent myself every time I opened a car door, trying on whichever personality happened to suit my mood. I never hitchhiked beyond the city limits until I was sent off to college and met a girl named Ronnie. Ronnie was tough and independent in a way I'd never known. Her mother had died in the living room while confined to an iron lung, and her father had remarried twice. Dale Knowles was creating his own major in beat literature. He carried a guitar. He'd lie barefoot on the side of the road with this head propped up on his knapsack, exercising his muscles. We hadn't even gotten our first ride before he pulled it out and began composing one of his appalling ballads. We were picked up by two young men in a Jeep who introduced themselves as Starsky and Hutch. They were wired and loopy, washing down over-the-counter amphetamines with quarts of malt liquor. When asked where they were from, Starsky made a gagging gesture. \"What about the police?\" \"Police?\" Starsky said. \"Hey, ho, buddy, we can outrun the damn police, no problem.\" He stood upon the gas pedal, and the Jeep peeled out of the station, driving over the concrete embankment and onto the interstate. Starsky and Hutch seemed to enjoy our pathetic displays of fear, jiggling the steering wheel and cutting off other drivers just so they could watch us cower and pray. We covered an enormous amount of ground in an hour before Starsky pulled over to relieve himself behind a billboard. Dale used the downtime as an opportunity to compose a few new songs. Ronnie and I stayed on for three months before taking off to pick pears in Oregon. Dale stayed for a week, leaving by bus the day after I walked in on him standing naked before a full length mirror singing. After the pears were finished, we picked apples and then headed up to Canada, back to California, and across the country. Ronnie thought she might stay awhile, and I decided to visit a former college roommate in Ohio. We slept in abandoned houses and open fields, under bridges and behind barbed-wire fences. \"I give and give to all of Uncle Sam's little takers. And I've been thinking that maybe it's about time I get a little something in return\" \"You, my young friend, are going to wash my car inside and out, and you're going to pay for it\" \"How does it feel to be giving for a change? Not much fun, is it?\" I got a ride back to the interstate and another that landed me 20 miles beyond Charleston, West Virginia. It was around 4 o'clock, and I hoped I might catch a long ride that would take me through to Ohio. I waited 10 minutes before someone slowed down and stopped 20 yards up the road. The man's shirt introduced him as T.W. \"I was hitchhiking because I'd made a bet with a friend that I could get from Duke to Kent State in 18 hours\" \"Look at me,\" he said, brushing the candy wrappers onto the floor, \"riding with a brain doctor\" It was dusk by this time, the sun fading behind the surrounding mountains. I waited an hour, two hours, three. It had gotten too dark to leave, as I had no idea where I was. Travel is supposed to broaden your mind, but it had a way of depressing me. T.W. staggered out of the bar at around 10 o'clock. He had his arms around a skinny, long-faced man and obese woman. He waved goodbye to the man and woman and proceeded to start the engine. \"Those are my friends,\" he said. \"You're coming with me,\" he said. \"Home to my house with me. I've got a place fixed up nice with rugs and toasters and a lot of things like that\" \"Big brain doctor, are you?\" he asked. \"Like to stick your fat little fingers in other people's skulls and tinker around?\" I was looking out at the wet road and didn't see it coming. He grabbed me by the hair and yanked my head down onto the seat. The gun felt just the way I always knew it would. He held it against the side of my face, the barrel butting against my jaw. \"He was such a nice man. We had no idea,\" she says. \"Jump and roll like Mannix, like Barnaby Jones\" \"He'll only shoot me down or shoot me now in the back maybe, in the head\" \"What I needed was a gun or a knife\" I thought to get up and run, but he was too close now. \"Hey, you, get back in this truck.\" He looked off to my right, and I understood that he couldn't see me. \"I'm not going to hurt you. I was only joking\" I ran down the exit ramp and into the middle of the interstate, waving my arms and begging someone to stop. The first two cars just missed hitting me, but the third pulled over. I told them what had happened, my voice high-pitched and breathy. The driver turned to me, saying, \"Sounds like you're a faggot yourself\" People began picking me up with the idea I had more to offer than gratitude. Drugs were the easy part. It was the sexual advances that got to me. When I though of sex, I pictured someone standing before me crying, \"I love you so much that I don't even know who I am anymore\" The writer hitchhiked from Atlanta to Fayetteville, N.C. to New York. He says he never learned to drive a car because it was too dangerous. He moved to cities with decent public transportation systems, Chicago and then New York, which is even better.

The heyday of liberalism meant a nation increasingly open about sexuality. Now, in our current moment of the Republican revolution, we're a nation that is increasingly getting in touch with our anger. Anger motivates voters. Anger is the engine behind 1,000 talk radio programs. In the 1980s, when Newt Gingrich was making videotapes and audiotapes for Republican candidates who were trying to win office, he told them to consciously use words and phrases that would polarize the political debate. So anger, anger is an inherent part of the current conservative revolution. CNN Radio's John Sutter uses the words sick, traitors, corrupt, bizarre, cheat, steal, devour, self-serving, and criminal rights. Sutter: We are a radio program. And we have the power to do the following thing. We'll stop the music. CNN's John Berman offers a prize to the person who can come up with the most interesting, grammatically correct sentence using the words \"sick, traitors, corrupt, bizarre, cheat\" The winner will get a coffee mug, or-- I don't know-- a seat in some congressional district. Ira Glass: GOP strategy is to cultivate anger of middle class people against the poor. Glass: People are angry, but they're not angry at things that are happening to them. He says this particular political revolution is trying to instill anger at welfare moms. Jack Hitt: The Susan Smith trial is a grisly case. He says she locked her two children into her car and then sank the car in a lake. Hitt says it was to help her keep this rich boyfriend, who didn't want children. Ira Glass watched the coverage in South Carolina a number of times. He said that what struck him was the pure rage that people had toward Susan Smith. People were sending in their milk money to help defray the cost of electrocuting her. Ira Glass: Jack Hitt wrote an op-ed piece about the Susan Smith trial. Hitt: This is a political style, for good or bad, that we're seeing a lot of in our country right now. Glass: Once the Smith trial drops off, they go pick up something else that will inflame their anger. Hitt: Even in this case, we have to have empathy. The anger has to turn to an attempt to understand why she did what she did and to forgive her. Hitt: It became a much more complicated story, less of a cartoon story, more of a sort of human story. Ira Glass: When Susan Smith was 13, she tried to kill herself. Glass: She went to a guidance counselor to say that her stepfather, Mr. Russell, was abusing her. He basically admitted to this, and nothing happened, Glass says. Glass says Smith went back to abusing his stepdaughter, was institutionalized. Jack Hitt's op-ed piece generated this huge response. He got lots of furious letters. He was used as a punching bag on talk radio. He noticed one significant change in the general mood of public anger. What he noticed was now some of the anger was directed at him. Ira Glass: Jack Hitt overstated the need for forgiveness in this case. Gregory Baruch: There has got to be a limit to where you forgive. Glass: What if her stepfather came in and said, well, I was abused as a kid too? Would we then have to hold out forgiveness to him as well? Forgiveness does not mean we let Susan Smith go, or that we eliminate the need for punishment. People who do bad things need punishment, and we need to punish them. Forgiveness and clemency are two different concepts. Ira Glass: My article is not about Susan Smith. It's about you and me. Glass: The whole idea of forgiveness is about us getting beyond this crime. Hitt: My piece is, finally, a kind of secular statement of what Christianity is. Gregory Baruch: The point of Christianity is that there needs to be empathy and forgiveness. He says forgiveness culture does not encourage people to choose the right path. Baruch says we may be better off in a culture that asks more of people. Gregory Baruch: There is a history in which crime has not been taken as seriously by a lot of people who place themselves on the left of the political spectrum. That really, I think, is what people were reacting to so strongly when Michael Dukakis had that famous line. He essentially responded that he would increase drug education in the schools. Jack Hitt: I don't want the idea of forgiveness to mean that we let people go. Gregory Baruch: My argument is that the pendulum has swung so far in the direction of punishment that that's all we care about. Ira Glass: Forgiveness is the right way to go. Jack Hitt: I don't know that it's a bad thing, when something terrible has been done, to stay angry at it, not to let it fade in our mind. Gregory Baruch: I like to think that I wouldn't be jaded, that when I hear something terrible, I will continue thinking it's terrible. Beverly Russell, Smith's stepfather, said he was guilty for what she did to her two sons. He said, \"Had I been true to you and my responsibilities, you would have been stronger in yourself\" \"My heart breaks for what I've done to you,\" he said. Polls show that in the little town of Union, South Carolina, where Susan Smith and Beverly Russell live, 75% of the residents have agreed with the jury's decision against the death penalty in her case. In the country as a whole, further away from the human reality of these people's lives, 75 per cent of the population believes that she should get the death sentence. Iris: I have provoked, qualified, justified, revoked, interred, summoned, questioned, realized, created, allowed, returned, configured, situated, and muted things I should not have. I only wish for you to hear me. I apologize for this also. Ira Glass: Larry Steeger's piece was based on the testimony of serial murderer Jeffrey Dahmer. Glass: Iris Moore's piece is an artifact of the forgiveness culture. Moore: \"I forgive everything until I am totally blank. I have no memory at all\" The murder rate is down in many big cities, including Chicago and New York. The prison population has skyrocketed, people are being taken off the street. But to give a sense of some of the human consequences of this, here's Darrin Bowden, a supervising attorney in Cook County. Darrin Bowden's life was on the line. He was threatened that if you do not either get the money, the drugs, or get the individual who stole the drugs. And yes, he should be held responsible for that. But where we erred, we were not concerned and compassionate enough. J.B. will be in his late thirties or early forties, I believe, when he's released, with no hope of receiving a job, because he's a convicted felon, convicted of murder. That record will follow him forever. If we had moved in the true spirit of the Juvenile Court Act, we would have decided that, hey, this is a young man who never had an opportunity, let's provide him with an opportunity. Ira Glass: Johnny Cash performed an adult act, but when you're a child, you speak and act as a child. Glen Fitzgerald sees all this from another angle. Create one sentence, grammatical sentence, an interesting sentence we hope, using these words. Glen Fitzgerald is a missionary with Youth for Christ. He tries to bring gang members over to the Lord. He says that when he goes out and talks to these suburbanites, these mostly white suburbanites about what goes on in the city, he says the reaction is usually the same. I'm talking about guys who are really-- these aren't wannabes. These are the real thing, dope dealing, gang violence between the two, what they would call, missions. And they will say to the kid, this is great what you're doing. But these other kids on the street, that's different. I think there's an unfortunate syndrome that many Christians fall prey to, and I'm speaking about my own brothers and sisters. One way or another, I'm still on their side. I still love them. But I got to be honest about what I'm seeing out there. Glen Fitzgerald, a missionary with Youth for Christ here in Chicago. grace is the substance of my relationship with God. It's not just a cute idea that's thrown in there. Ira Glass: One sign, perhaps the best sign, of just how widespread in our culture is this idea that we [INTERPOSING MUSIC] Colin Powell: Show leadership. Be a conciliator. Move the country forward toward lower government, less government. Colin Powell: Try to restore a sense of family, restore asense of shame in our society. Colin. Powell: Put us in a more fiscally responsible platform basis. In the interest of equal time, we're going to hear about sinners. One of the things about sin, besides the fact that many sinners are not seeking forgiveness, is that sin is not easy. And this next little story from Cheryl Trykv is a vivid illustration of what that means. The writer met Sally and Pat two nights before at an amiable little tavern up the street. What a night that was, laughing and joking, crazy photo booth sessions, $0.50 shots of Jagermeister, and a very generous barkeep Sally seemed to know rather well. I'd like to illustrate to the young man that he's made a mistake, that I'm not what he thinks I am. And as a matter of fact, I'm on my way to get high, and quite possibly, we share something of a bond. I turn to him and say, all bugs are not cockroaches. Sally eats her dinner like a little cat-rabbit, nibbling and licking away. She drinks her wine with little laps of the tongue. I got a letter in the mail today from my friend, Miao, in Seattle. Sally asks if I will get on God's Holy Spaceship. She says, everyone in Seattle is talking about it. Pat says, he would rather get on the superhighway and meet God there on own. Like the bus, the spaceship will only be a breeding ground for TB. Sally says she will not get on God's Holy Spaceship if there is anything on TV, because that would mean that someone would still be left on Earth. Pat looks at me as though there were a horrible smell coming from my direction. Sally asks, what if I can't see that Oprah already has her seat? Pat mutters, as if anyone cares. I ask Sally probing questions about her childhood and family. I feign interest in her affairs, her many, many affairs, one right after another. I imagine Sally's service is readily available to any adventurous commuter on God's Holy Spaceship who would offer her a smile. Sally asks Pat to get me some Advil from the bathroom. She picks up the classified section of theReaderand scans the personals leisurely. Pat crunches himself up quickly 50 times before disengaging himself from the rack. He executes a midair flip to get down and tells me I wouldn't have such bad cramps if I got more exercise. Cheryl darling, will you get me Pat's jacket from the coat tree in the hall? Yes, pet, of course. A shift is taking place, we are rounding the bend. I pretend I don't know or care that Sally must be sending me to retrieve something very special. I watch Sally light and suck up the bong. anything spread with peanut butter? Her pretty little pixie face stuns me. Bundy, she calls. And from the other room jogs in a black dog, with a mix of doberman and rottweiler. Ira Glass: Why wouldn't Sally make a wonderful bunk mate? I wonder if sometimes I am too much of a snob.

Now, in our current moment of the Republican revolution, we're a nation that is increasingly getting in touch with our anger. Anger sells. Anger motivates voters.

CNN Radio's John Sutter reads the words \"sick, traitors, corrupt, bizarre, cheat, steal, devour, self-serving\" and \"criminal rights\" Sutter: \"I wonder if it's possible to use all those in one sentence? I'm just looking at the words here. Sick traitors\" CNN.com's John Sutter offers a prize for the best grammatically correct sentence. The winner will get a coffee mug or a seat in some congressional district yet to be named. Sutter: Cultivating anger amongst the voters is not just a tactic used by conservatives. He says it's been a mainstay strategy of the left too. Ira Glass: People are angry, but they're not angry at things that are happening to them. Glass: This particular political revolution is trying to instill anger at welfare moms. He says people are angry at the O.J. Verdict. Jack Hitt: The Susan Smith trial is a grisly case. He says she locked her two children in her car and then sank the car in a lake. Hitt says she did it to keep her rich boyfriend from having children. Jack Hitt: What struck him was the pure rage that people had toward Susan Smith. People were sending in their milk money to help defray the cost of electrocuting her. Perhaps the most horrific image was to see this town of good Christians sort of gathering at the police station door when she was first brought out. Jack Hitt wrote an op-ed piece for the Washington Post. He argued for a different kind of response to the Susan Smith trial. Hitt: Even in this case, even in a case so horrible that no one could possibly sympathize with the criminal. Hitt: Even in this case, we have to have empathy. The anger has to turn to an attempt to understand why she did what she did and to forgive her. Hitt: It became a much more complicated story, less of a cartoon story, more of a sort of human story. Ira Glass: Susan Smith was abused by her stepfather, a Republican county chairman. Glass: When she was 16, she went to a guidance counselor to report the abuse. He admitted to it, she was institutionalized, he went back to abusing her, Glass says. Glass says Smith committed an unspeakable act at 23. Jack Hitt's op-ed piece generated this huge response. He got lots of furious letters. He was used as a punching bag on talk radio. We thought that we would give one of them a chance, here, to discuss it with him. Jack Hitt: There has got to be a limit to where you forgive. Gregory Baruch: What if her stepfather came in and said, well, I was abused as a kid too, and that's why I had to pass on the cycle of abuse to Susan? Forgiveness does not mean we let Susan Smith go, or that we eliminate the need for punishment. Forgiveness and clemency are two different concepts. People who do bad things need punishment, and we need to punish them. Ira Glass: My piece is, finally, a kind of secular statement of what Christianity is. Glass: I was alarmed that most of the people who reacted with such fury at my piece were themselves alleged abusers. Hitt: The whole idea of forgiveness is about us getting beyond this crime. Gregory Baruch: The point of Christianity is that there needs to be empathy and forgiveness. He says forgiveness culture does not encourage people to choose the right path. Baruch says we may be better off in a culture that asks more of people. Jack Hitt: Gregory Baruch is arguing, essentially, that too much forgiveness is dangerous for a society. That is, that people cease to take people like Susan Smith seriously. Ira Glass: I get the sense that you feel like we've had enough of that. Jack Hitt: The pendulum has swung so far in the direction of punishment that that's all we care about. Gregory Baruch: I think that the idea of forgiveness is the right way to go. Ira Glass: But I don't know that it's a bad idea. Jack Hitt: It's not selfish to stay angry when it's a bad thing that has been done to somebody else. Gregory Baruch: You could also consider the testimony of Susan Smith's stepfather, Beverly Russell. Ira Glass: Susan Smith drops off the radar this week, don't worry. In his testimony he said, \"You don't have all the guilt in this tragedy\" At that point he cried, apparently, on the stand. \"My heart breaks for what I've done to you, for your pain and loss,\" he said. In the town where Susan Smith and Beverly Russell live, 75% of the residents have agreed with the jury's decision against the death penalty in her case. In the country as a whole, further away from the human reality of these people's lives, 75 per cent of the population believes that she should get the death sentence. Iris Moore: I've caused anguish, hurt, pain, and suffering in other families. I've done things which should not have been done. If I am misunderstood, you have only me to blame. I apologize for this also. I'm sorry. Ira Glass: The notion that our society needs to be less forgiving, that we need to be harsher with people. Glass: But if you think about this philosophically, you have to acknowledge that it has practical consequences as social policy. The murder rate is down in many big cities, including Chicago and New York. The prison population has skyrocketed, people are being taken off the street. But to give a sense of some of the human consequences of this, here's Darrin Bowden, a supervising attorney in Cook County. Darrin Bowden stole his narcotics. His life was on the line. And, basically surviving, J.B. pulls a trigger, takes a human life. And yes, he should be held responsible for that. But where we erred, we were not concerned and compassionate enough.

A conservative will tell you if this guy did a crime, he's lousy, and something bad should happen to him. A liberal will say, this person did a really bad thing, because of their parents mistreating them. Colin Powell: Show leadership. Be a conciliator. Move the country forward toward lower government, less government. \"Help bring more civility into our society,\" he says. \"Restore a sense of shame in our society\" \"Put us in a more fiscally responsible platform basis\" We're talking about sinners, basically. story of people who do not have much of a sense of shame in their society, and in fact, are not looking for forgiveness. One of the things about sin, besides the fact that many sinners are not seeking forgiveness, is that sin is not easy. Sin is not just all fun and games. \"I just met Sally and Pat two nights before at an amiable little tavern up the street on Damon. What a night that was, laughing and joking, crazy photo booth sessions, $0.50 shots of Jagermeister, and a very generous barkeep\" Sally is glad to see me, very glad. For dinner she's made her favorite, noodles with pepper and garlic, lots of pepper,Lots of garlic. Pat is glad also but is much less physical about it. No juicy lip kisses from Pat. Just a bare chest with two self-piercing nipple rings, a shaved head. Sally eats her dinner like a little cat-rabbit , nibbling and licking away. I watch her eat and talk at the same time. I got a letter in the mail today from my friend, Miao, in Seattle. I use the notion of God's Holy Spaceship to lure Pat back into the confines of deference and civility. Pat's face will not let up that I've offended his sense of aesthetic. Mistaking Miao for Meow, how could I have been so careless? He says, he would rather get on the superhighway and meet God there on own. Sally says she will not get on God's Holy Spaceship if there is anything on TV, because that would mean that someone would still be left on Earth. She asks, what if I can't see that Oprah already has her seat? Pat looks at me as though there were a horrible smell coming from my direction. I ask Sally probing questions about her childhood and family. I feign interest in her affairs, her many, many affairs, one right after another. I imagine Sally's service is readily available to any adventurous commuter on God's Holy Spaceship who would offer her a smile. Sally invites her husband, Pat, over for dinner. Pat hangs like a bat from a bar on the rack off the ceiling. Sally asks Pat to get me some Advil from the bathroom. Pat pops the top off the Advil container and asks how many, one or two? Cheryl darling, will you get me Pat's jacket from the coat tree in the hall? Yes, pet, of course. A shift is taking place, we are rounding the bend. I pretend I don't know or care that Sally must be sending me to retrieve something very special. I watch Sally light and suck up the bong. She holds it in and blows it out all over Bundy's face. Bundy is a black dog, with a mix of doberman and rottweiler. I try not to think of myself on God's Holy Spaceship with Sally as my bunk mate. Ira Glass: Why wouldn't Sally make a wonderful bunk mate? All bugs are not cockroaches, I think to myself. Now to review our little contest that we announced at the beginning of the show.

Ira Glass: By this point in the Christmas season, people are pretty much tired of the regular Christmas records. A new radio theater company created by writer David Sedaris, his sister Amy, a bunch of other people. Glass: Christmas is the one day in the American year when, more than any other, we are handed exactly the same stage. At Christmas, everybody is trying to fashion a day out of exactly the same materials. When people do that, you could see exactly who chooses, what they choose, and why. At Christmas, the kind hearted have an event on which they can exercise theirkind heartedness. The manipulative and controlling have a set of meals and gifts with which to manipulate others. Everybody is themselves but more so. Gene Larkin was inundated with requests to tell another Christmas story. He decided to break his pattern of saying no to himself.

The Center for Annex Learning is a former indoor skating facility the city fathers have turned into what they call a school without walls. The classrooms are separated by curtains, but that's just for the sake of privacy. The real walls are in our minds. And the center is devoted to helping us. \"I can't stand walls, not anymore. You should see what I've done with my house\" \"Writing for the Holidays\" is a way of making yourself some real money. \"How many of you would like that [JINGLING BELLS] jingling sound to come from your pockets?\" If you spent last Christmas coaching midget league basketball or designing a patio, chances are, the editors over atCatFancyorChocolatieraren't going to be too interested.

The fine print, even the advertisements will give you an indication of who these people are and how the editors try to reach them. If any of you don't want to publish a holiday story, I'm afraid I can't help you. I expect every single one of you to hold a contract in your hands. I'd take that money, the paper clutched tight. And I'd use it to fly, like a soft prayer-carpet. It was a great class. Everyone was really into it. And the teacher, he had this way of firing us up and cracking the type of whip you knew wouldn't break the surface of your skin. The teacher though, he explained how those same feelings of jubilation or sorrow can be reproduced through drugs and alcohol or tossing a hard, cold body into a shallow grave. Playing Gene Larkin: \"He was so smart that way, always reminding us that we were all people\" Playing Woman 1: \"A really small knapsack filled with nail polish. It's lying there on the futon\" Playing Coach: \"Can you believe it? You couldn't find a sweeter, more talented group of girls\" The class started in early September, so as to allow us to finish our stories early enough to allow magazines, what they call, their lead-time. The sky was cloudless, the color of a burnished silver platter on that day when daddy and I set out with our aging spaniel Curtis in search of, what we considered to be, the perfect Christmas tree. It was hard to think about the holidays when, technically, it was late summer, and people were still dressed in shorts and halter tops. But the teacher, he did his best to get us into the spirit. It wasn't easy or fun, but we did it to remind ourselves what we were. The teacher had us start each class with a carol. We all shaved ice, wrapped empty boxes as gifts, and sent fake, funny checks to charities. One day he even brought chestnuts into the class and roasted them, right there, on a small, charcoal grill. \"Doe for a Deer,\" from the December '94 issue ofMountedGameMonthly. make one little girl's dreams come true. The story clocked in at about 945 words. The magazine pays how much per word? $0.55 per word. The class takes a look at how Gene Larkin could have made more money by using a more descriptive vocabulary. The class uses adjectives and adverbs to make a 29-word sentence. The teacher uses the word needle to describe a sharp, pin-like device. Playing Irish StudentHuh, the O'Shaughnessys on my mother's side, they thought they were all too good for tents. I'd be up at 3:00 in the morning, digging their lean-tos and huts out of the cold ground. The teacher discouraged us from talking about our stories, for fear of inciting the sort of jealousy that often results in bloodshed or small fires. On the last day of class, we each arrived carrying our completed holiday story, ready for submission. And then we celebrated with punch and carols, laughing and reminiscing until the sun set on that late October afternoon. Gene Larkin spent a few weeks getting re-acquainted with himself. Then he took a job at one of the several petting mangers in his town. It was right after Thanksgiving. Maybe I was showing off. I drove my go-kart into the pettingManger. And some of these animals, the camels and so forth, they spook a little too easy. Playing Southern Student was the year each child received a slingshot. Taka, Soil, Prescott, and I lay huddled in our beds, rowdy as newborn lambs vying for a swollen teat. The world spunt on it's frosty axis, and morning arrived. The brilliant sun trumpeting the arrival of this day. Basketball season had started early that year. And with my starting forward out with a torn meniscus, it didn't seem my Christmas was going to merry. The rubber band attached with pride and precision. Now, I can catch us a squirrel for supper, said Prescott, the youngest. She wanted to shake it, not just the tree or the jagged ice daggers dripping from the roof, but the whole damn thing.

Our play by David Sedaris and the Pine Tree Gang, exclusively here on YourRadioPlayhouseradio program. Faith Tabernacle Baptist Church Choir from Chicago's South Side. Beau O'Riley's story is a story from his childhood living outside Chicago. Two weeks before Christmas in 1966, I lost my entire thumbnail closing a classroom window as part of the Sister Edwardine seventh graders helped the school close their windows program. It was warm that day, unseasonable, and all the windows were wide open. I'd been assigned to close them all up every day. And they were huge, swinging, picture-window type windows. I was five nine and a half in 1966 and built like a garden hose that had been used so many times that it has lost all sense of its rubbery toughness, its definition, and hangs like a limp spiral. My body was like that, pale skin wrapped around awkward bones. And that body had reached its full man-height at the end of the six grade. Previously, my childhood had laid itself out as one continuous torture chamber of belly clenching, flush producing fear, when it came to anything like running, jumping, or slamming. And now here I was, under the basket, pounding my dribble with my left hand, the bowling pin thumb riding the ball. suddenly, I was eligible because of a quirk of genetics but still eligible. \"Odd-head\" was a phrase for me to have heard at home. The phrase hung way back in my cultural awareness, shadows of trailer parks. John Crescent had all this about him. He spoke with a heavy, Tennessee, sweet-slur to his vowels. John Crescent grabbed my thumb and squeezed it hard. The pain went up my spine, and I popped my eyes open. I didn't know John Crescent before this. I had never had a conversation with him. And here he was squeezing my poor thumb. I hit him with my right hand. A clumsy punch that missed his chin and glanced his Adam's apple. And I hit him again, this time, somewhere near the chest, with my left hand. The little Napoleon digit crying out with more pain that made my spine jump for revenge. I hit him again anyway. Jon Crescent was reluctant to hit me back. He kept pushing me away with this long basketball arms and not throwing any punches of his own. We were interrupted, finally, by Sister Edwardine. Her sharp caws of Stop it, stop it now!\" broke the boys apart. Christmas Eve. The lake froze solid. And I woke up to the early quiet, intending to go out and pick up the family Christmas tree. Why I went alone that year, I don't remember. Usually, I would have gone with my multitude of brothers and sisters. John Crescent was the son of the Christmas tree guy. My tree of choice was frozen to the ground. For a couple of minutes, the two of us had to struggle to work it free. And once we had, we stood for a moment in the morning cold.

Someone steps out of the closed doors to the waiting area and calls out the name of the minor respondent. The public defender meets his client in a small, bare, interview room. The client is 14 years old, and has been held for two weeks, so far, on a very serious charge of violent crime. His hearing, which will take place in two more weeks, will determine whether he will be tried as a juvenile, in this building, and have some chance to straighten out and go free again. The child is told he is going to be given psychological tests and then there will be another session before the judge to determine where he will be tried. If he is convicted as an adult, he will probably remain in prison for the rest of his life. His attorney says, that depends, but it'sGoing to be a while. The child looks at every corner of the room and not at his attorney. Is it more important to react when someone is on you, the attorney says, or to not spend the rest of your life in jail? If the judge hears you've got written up, he's going to think that you're not taking this seriously. The child is taken back into the part of the building that is behind locks. His attorney says of him, he isn't going to make it. What he has to do is more than any adult could be reasonably expected to be able to do. And he's only 14.

As of last Sunday, Faith Tabernacle has raised $101,000. That's an incredible amount given how many people they are, and what people there make. It comes out to about $2,000 per person, on top of tithing. Christmas, in a certain sense, is about tomorrow. The child was is just born in the darkness of winter. He is bringing light with him.

Evan Harris and a coworker were in the mail room at the extremely low-level office jobs that they held. Harris: \"That was the pivot point around which my entire life turned and spun and went into a totally different direction\" Evan Harris's life took a 180 degree turn when he heard the words, \"Shouldn't the letter Q be further toward the back of the alphabet?\" Today on our program, Quitting, stories of people who quit everything in their lives that they hated and what happened to them afterwards. In their minds, Q does not belong in the middle of the alphabet where it is. Q, in their mind, has more character. And Q, of course, is the first letter of the word \"quit.\" You can't spell \"quit\" without Q. Evan Harris and her friend Shelley Ross decided to publish a little zine, a little Xerox thing, just a couple pages long. They decided the qualities were that kind of fierce independence that they saw in the letter Q. And they talked about quitting for a long time that day. Evan Harris and Shelley Ross write about quitting in their book QuitterQuarterly. Ira Glass asks: What if your muse calls you to do something hokey and out-of-date, like singing in coffeehouses or I don't even know? Evan Harris was writing about quitting, and thinking about quitting. She gathered the strength to quit her job and her boyfriend and her city, which she did. Quitting euphoria is an incredible thing. It's like being in love kind of, except it's being inLove with your decision. Evan Harris: Quits and potential quits seemed to be everywhere. She would go out with a friend for coffee and, of course, talk about all this quitting business. And so really now there's nothing to do but build, she says. Evan Harris: In everybody's life, there is something of a quitting cycle. He says it's better to willfully quit whatever it is and then go on to the next thing. Harris: You have to be doing something, than to just kind of let things fall apart. There's the quitting cycle and then there's the nature of quitters. I don't think quitters are lazy people necessarily. I think that the essential nature of a quitter is to be able to cut their losses and move on. Quitting is about having one's own volition to do whatever. The word \"quitter\" does have a negative connotation, and that's something that I would really like to change. I see quitters as people who have volition. QuitterQuarterlyas a thing is definitely pro-quitting propaganda. The more things you quit, the more potential you have for success. The anatomy of a quit. The quitter thinks about it. about it some more. And then there's the post-quitting stuff. To me this indicates somebody who actually has been in that position. It goes on for a really long, long time before you actually then do the quit. Evan Harris talks about the great quits which have driven world history. All the wars and strife of the millennia are, in fact, better understood as a series of quits. She delves into quitting issues that are so esoteric, so erudite, that it would be hard, I think, for anyone else to understand them. Quitting itself has an identity, and your particular quit fits into the world. The point of quitting is to move in the world and to get bigger and bigger as a person. And you have to remember that your quit is going to influence another person's quit, potentially. Quitting is not just about how it feels to yourself. I don't think that's true. And I think that people have to see themselves in a swim of quitting. I really am. now. I have to say, in all of my life, you are the only person I've ever met who thinks of it that way. Evan Harris: \"I don't, in a very literal way, have anything to quit anymore\" \"I suppose I could quit smoking or quit eating things that are bad for me\" \"There's a lot of little quits that I might do just to tide me over\" QuitterQuarterly, P.O.

All the dogs in a suburban Los Angeles neighborhood quit their suburban lives. Life seems as drab and dry as dust to two particular dogs. Rusty and Boots, the neighborhood dog sentinels, are barking out a message. One by one, each other dog in the neighborhood bolt to their back gates. And indeed, there in the alley it is the most famous dog of all time, Buck. Joey and Flipper can almost hear theNationalGeographictheme playing. It is the sound of 2,000 Maasai warriors, hirpling across the desert. The dogs overleap their back gates, which used to be impossible, but now seems ridiculously easy.  Joey's over. And his skirt lifts out behind him like a magic cape. And he and the other dogs are sailing, flying over the San Fernando Valley. For the first time, they look down at the humming suburban grid that was outside that back gate. Act One: The suburban grid is the most fascinating thing the dogs have ever seen. Act Two: The dogs sail away from it all, over the Angeles Crest mountains, disappearing in a burst of a magical star shower. It'sYourRadioPlayhouse. The stages of quitting according to Ms. Evan Harris, editor, co-writer ofQuitterQuarterly. You think about it some more. Then maybe you quit. Maybe you feel that quitting euphoria as you soar over the suburbs. But I think that it is just as likely that you do not quit. The recordings were made by the next-door neighbors of Raymond and Peter. This all happened in San Francisco in the late 1980s. The apartment building this took place in was built like a cheap motel and had very thin walls. They fought with a raging abandon and total disregard for everyone in the building. Two men say they never figured out if Raymond and Peter were a gay couple or if they were just straight roommates. The first crudely-recorded session featured a monologue by Ray muttering to himself about his desire to kill. There was something so nakedly sinister about the recording that we were shocked, mystified. OurRadioPlayhouseradio program includes warning signs about when it is time to quit a relationship. The thing about this couple is that they get into a kind of fight that only very well-established couples or roommates or people who work together get into. When you find yourself in that situation it's time to start thinking about, maybe I should quit this relationship. Ray: \"I don't want to watch queer mother [BLEEP]. I want to watching something decent, like--PeterSorry. Go somewhere else and watch it then. Don't touch-RayDon't you touch me. You were the one that put your hands on me\" Ira Glass: Arguing can be one of the most intimate things that people can do together. In the middle of a big argument, one of them is so inside the other one's head and knows so much about him that, at one point, to humiliate him, he starts to call him women's names. Ira Glass: The utter cruelty of that last comment is just breathtaking. Ray: I've told you that you're a--PeterOK, Alice. OK, Julie. Go back in there. I don't attack, Mabel. I'm not going to attack you. Lisa Buscani says she has nothing against work per se. She just can't bring herself to go to work. She says the stages of quitting are similar to the stages in a love story. The final step is to say goodbye to your partner. I think of post office murals and 1950's communist propaganda. pushing onward, always onward via honest sweat of brow is attractive to me. I think of well-constructed women in business suits, dashing through airports to catch that last flight to Rome, manhandling a potential empire crashing crisis. Her motto was this-- yell, yell, and yell some more. If they're there the next morning, you've lost your touch. She stood over my shoulder constantly, criticizing my work with raptorial fervor. When I did screw up, as employees inevitably do when told they can do nothing else, she was all over me. As horrible as it was, I couldn't just leave. She paid me $12,000 a year. Even with a second job on weekends, I barely got by. My friends nicknamed me Florence Nightingale. No one could nurse a drink like I could. When review time rolled around, two months later than she said it would, she told me she wasn't going to give me a raise. Raises were given on merit in her office. My work did not merit a raise, she said. The room was suddenly very literally light. Robert Metrick first performed in Chicago's Club Lower Lengths. \"I was weightless but I had control, like astronauts after they learn to swim properly in space\" \"To kiss him so hard and hold him sohard that the act itself is forgotten. That's a gift\" I couldn't quit it because this was one so easy. On the morning of the first night he stayed with me, I woke up and looked at him and found home. To be alone again meant an energy my aging had confiscated. And even though I was still alone with him, a future was the crumb of consolation. Dwight Okita has this poem about quitting from his bookCrossingwiththeLight. He wrote it back when he worked as a dance instructor. It's about a student he became and how he felt light, too, but it was the way you are before you catch a cold. Dwight Okita: \"How many men does it take to lift a woman's spirits?\" \"I want it always to be fun,\" he says. \"Peaches, pears, apples, plums. Tell me when your birthday comes\" \"The Farewell Samba\" by Dwight Okita. Philip Larkin's \"Poetry of Departures\" \"We all hate home,\" Larkin writes. \"I detect my room,/ It's specially-chosen junk,/ The good books, the good bed\" Ira Glass: What will make you change? For most of us, it is not self-help books, courses at the learning annex. We are immune to resolutions made at the last minute of the last hour of each December 31.Consider the story of Evan Harris. Evan Harris was \"well-entrenched in my life and pretty much sleepwalking\" He and a coworker were in the mail room at the extremely low-level office jobs that they held. \"That was the pivot point around which my entire life turned\" Evan Harris: \"Shouldn't the letter Q be further toward the back of the alphabet?\" With those words, Evan Harris's life took a 180 degree turn. Coming up, writer Sandra Tsing Loh, Lisa Buscani, and others. In their minds, Q does not belong in the middle of the alphabet where it is. Q, in their mind, has more character. It makes demands and it sees that they are met. And Q, of course, is the first letter of the word \"quit\" Evan Harris and her friend Shelley Ross started talking about what it means to be able to quit something. They decided the qualities were that kind of fierce independence that, in fact, they saw in the letter Q. And they talked about quitting for a long time that day. Evan Harris wrote about quitting in her new book, QuitterQuarterly. She says she couldn't choose who she fell in love with, or what she wanted to write about. Harris: \"We cannot choose our muse. And quitting was the muse that called\" Quitter Quarterlyis like a scientific inquiry into the properties of quitting. Quitting euphoria is an incredible thing. I don't know how much you have quit, but there's an incredible charge to quitting that is like a drug. It's like being in love kind of, except it's in love with your decision. Evan Harris: Quitting started to seem like the engine that made everything in the world go round. Harris: My first big quit was to leave the college that I was going to, and I moved to New York City. And so now I have nothing left to quit. I mean I've quit my boyfriend. I've Quit my city. Evan Harris: In everybody's life, there is something of a quitting cycle. He says it's better to willfully quit whatever it is and then go on to the next thing. Harris: You have to be doing something, than to just kind of let things fall apart. There's the quitting cycle and then there's the nature of quitters, which I think is important. I don't think quitters are lazy people necessarily. I think that the essential nature of a quitter is to be able to cut their losses and move on. Quitting is about being willful. The word \"quitter\" does have a negative connotation, and that's something that I would really like to change. I see quitters as people who have volition. QuitterQuarterlyas a thing is definitely pro-quitting propaganda. But I'm not so much describing what quits feel like. The anatomy of a quit is that the quitter thinks about it. And then there's the post-quitting stuff. To me this indicates somebody who actually has been in that position. It goes on for a really long, long time before you actually then do the quit. Evan Harris talks about the great quits which have driven world history. All the wars and strife of the millennia are, in fact, better understood as a series of quits. She delves into quitting issues that are so esoteric, so erudite, that it would be hard, I think, for anyone else to not just understand them. Quitting itself has an identity, and your particular quit fits into the world. The point of quitting is to move in the world and to get bigger and bigger as a person. And you have to remember that your quit is going to influence another person's quit, potentially. Quitting is not just about how it feels to yourself. I don't think that's true. And I think that people have to see themselves in a swim that way. I'm thinking about getting up and walking out of this room right now. I really am. the time. Evan Harris: \"I don't, in a very literal way, have anything to quit anymore\" \"I suppose I could quit smoking or quit eating things that are bad for me\" \"There's a lot of little quits that I could execute which I might do just to tide me over\" QuitterQuarterly is published by Ira Glass and Evan Harris. A copy is $0.25 plus the cost of one thin American stamp. If you would like a copy, get a pencil. It's P.O. Box 20515, Tompkins Square Station, New York. Life seems as drab and dry as dust to two particular dogs. But then, at that moment, Joey and Flipper hear this magical call. Rusty and Boots, the neighborhood dog sentinels, are barking out a message. One by one, each other dog in the neighborhood bolt to their back gates. Buck, the Husky from Jack London'sCalloftheWild, sings in shimmering tenor. \"Come, you dogs. Come to Canada. Big mountains, big valleys, big sky, big water. It's Marlboro country\" Joey's over. And his skirt lifts out behind him like a magic cape. And he and the other dogs are sailing, flying over the San Fernando Valley. For the first time, they look down at the humming suburban grid that was outside that back gate the whole time. Dogs find suburban grid the most fascinating thing they've ever seen. Never, in the history of Western civilization, has the nest seemed quite so empty as it does today. Dogs sail away from it all, over the Angeles Crest mountains, disappearing in a magical star shower. The stages of quitting according to Ms. Evan Harris, editor, co-writer ofQuitterQuarterly. When is it time to quit? When is enough enough? Ray: If you try to touch me, I will kill you in a [BLEEP] minute. The recordings were made by the next-door neighbors of Raymond and Peter. The apartment building this took place in was built like a cheap motel and had very thin walls. The two guys, the neighbors who moved in-- Eddie Lee Sausage and Mitchell D. are their names. Raymond and Peter are two roommates who recorded a series of rants about homosexuality. The two men say they did it because they thought somebody might try to kill somebody else. They never figured out if Raymond and Peter were a gay couple or if they were just straight roommates. RadioPlayhouseradio includes warning signs about when it is time to quit a relationship. The thing about this couple is that they get into a kind of fight that only very well-established couples or roommates or people who work together get into. It's a fight which begins with the smallest fact of daily life. Ray: \"I would like to have eaten tonight also, but I can't because of you talking about toenails\" Peter: \"We've been trying to watch this TV show. Can't we watch it?\" Ray: \"Why should you watch this, you [BLEEP] piece of [BLEep]?\" Ira Glass: Arguing can be one of the most intimate things that people can do together. In the middle of a big argument, one of them is so inside the other one's head and knows so much about him, Glass says. Peter: I'm not going to attack you. You're a sick little man. Ray: You ain't nothing but a [BLEEP] piece of [BLEep]. Peter: OK, Alice. OK, Julie. Go back in there. RayBull [BLEEP].Ira Glass: The utter cruelty of that last comment is just breathtaking. They do talk about leaving each other on the CD, but they never do leave each other. As Evan Harris says, the stages of quitting are: You think about it. You think it some more. Sometimes you quit. And in their case, you just keep thinking about it somemore. I think of post office murals and 1950's communist propaganda. Strong, textured, geometric men in the stoic blue of the overall and the work shirt. Courageously braving the hell of the forge, lifting their ruddy cheeks and angular chins to God or government. The publisher was a shrunken, shrewish woman in her 50's, the kind of woman who thought the word \"broad\" was a badge of honor. She stood over my shoulder constantly, criticizing my work with raptorial fervor, waiting like a blood-mouthed hyena for the moment I tripped up and made an error. As horrible as it was, I couldn't just leave. She paid me $12,000 a year. Even with a second job on weekends, I barely got by. My friends nicknamed me Florence Nightingale. No one could nurse a drink like I could. The breaking came when review time rolled around, two months later than she said it would. Raises were given on merit in her office, she said. My work did not merit a raise. I stood, walked to my desk, took my office keys off the chain, and walked out. Ira Glass talks to Lisa Buscani about her relationship with Robert Metrick. Metrick first performed in Chicago's Club Lower Lengths. More from her in a minute. But first this song from Metrick: \"The Calendar Song\" I couldn't quit it because I had been alone much of my life. To be alone again meant an energy my aging had confiscated. On the morning of the first night he stayed with me, I woke up and looked at him and found home. remembered is skin and hair and warmth. That's a gift. I couldn't quit it because it didn't fit the only picture I had. My parents knew the necessary work of love. If they could work dogged for their heart, so could I, I thought. And even though I was still alone with him, a future was the crumb of consolation. Dwight Okita writes about a student he became friends with as a dance instructor.

            " This American Life is produced for the ear and designed to be heard. The show includes emotion and emphasis that's not on the page. At this point, no one in American life seems bigger than life. Not the president, not Michael Jordan, not Courtney or Madonna. The Beatles came out with these big TV documentaries and rare never-before-heard outtakes from their studio sessions. The Fab Four basically come across as exhausted, irritated. They prattle on in a mundane way on obvious subjects. And they are no more glamorous, really, than you or me. Paul Mccartney bought two Hong Kong suits. They have been rendered in human scale and not one inch bigger. Ringo Starr got a few good presents on his birthday, but no in particular. John Lennon and George Lennon have not had any made. Paul Mccartney: \"We stuck in a wilder number\" Woman: \"What was your most enjoyable part of your vacation?\" Man: \"Just lazing around. We were on vacation.\" Woman:\"Do you mind the girls on the hill?\" Claudia Perez is an 18-year-old high school student in Chicago. She tells us what the year was like in one small Chicago neighborhood. The year was a big year in music, the year in films and world events and world politics. Chicago has more Mexicans than any other United States city except for Los Angeles. Little Village is the neighborhood that most new Mexican immigrants come to. Claudia is from this neighborhood and says that the place to go, if you really want to understand what the neighborhood's like, is 26th Street. There's a big archway on 26th Street, near the discount mall. The clock on it, donated by the Mexican government, stopped working a few weeks after it was installed. There are also green and white and red lights arranged in the shape of the Mexican flag. That's when you're entering Little Village. In 1995 the number of stores in the neighborhood actually increased 20%. The salesmen at Rossi Brothers had a good year. Maybe it's because our fathers are retired and retired. I don't know why business is better, says one salesman. Some stores had a good year. For some, it was so-so. The discount mall is probably 40 or 50 stores packed into an old department store building. The Virgin of Guadalupe is on T-shirts and framed pictures. So many Mexicans have done well in Chicago that lots of them have moved away from this neighborhood to the suburbs. Poles who come to her store look but don't buy. They worry that the Mexican merchants don't give them the best price. CJ's Clothing is almost all teenagers. One boy is 17, originally from Mexico, from Michoacan. This year he met this girl in Mexico who lived in Chicago. He liked her and followed her over here. But he stayed here, and now he is making money to help out his family. Miguel is a salesperson at CJ's. He's 19, has a goatee, is tall, [INAUDIBLE] complexion. He had a wish for 1996: \"To hook up with some girl that I want right now\" Miguel asks Claudia for her phone number. \"I guess she's got one of those strict parents,\" Miguel says. \"We'll see if he calls. We'll see,\" Claudia replies. \"You can write a book about me,\" Miguel adds. Ira Glass: I got fired from my job because I lied on my application. I usually stop by at 12:00 or 1:00 in the morning. They have good tortas, the best tortas. If I'm on a diet, I'll just drink a licuado de fresa. Man: \"The jail ain't for getting you straight. It just makes you worse\" Woman: \"It will always stay with her, deep down inside, because she never got the chance to meet her grandfather\" Girl: \"Now she knows that she has to stay in school and continue her education\" Community policing is one of the main reasons crime rates are going down here. The gang situations, that's being curbed. As far as 26th Street, the merchants, there's hardly any robberies and very few thefts. The crime rate, it's low. It's a lot lower. Ira Glass meets a young couple who had a baby and a two-year-old daughter. The husband says he bought a brand-new home in the Southwest side of Chicago. \"That's my dream, is to have my own house,\" the husband says. Mario and Alice Ramirez have been together for four years. Their daughter has been growing happily and healthy. \"We've got nice blessings this year, you know,\" Mario says. \"I just totally fell in love with that,\" Alice says. Mario Ramirez: My daughter called me a real bad word. She just goes, hey, you-- and everyone started laughing, so it was nice. He held the baby, his wife took her two-year-old daughter's hand, and they walked away down 26th Street in the snow. Mix tape is a taste of what Latinos in the South Side and everywhere else listen to. Doesn't this music sound more vital, more alive, than the certain music of a certain group of aging baby-boom '60s era? You, you, beloved listener, you be the judge. Ira Glass: My New Year's resolution was to finish this next story and finally get it on the radio. It's a story that I began over a year ago, and it involved many, many other people. The story does involve this entire church, a historic church here in Chicago. Karen Hutt was the first black child to integrate the Philadelphia public schools. Her family moved to a white, Jewish neighborhood, and she enrolled in the white public school there. There were about three black families, and lots of good will and excitement about this experiment. Karen Hutt: I was really resisting, because all my friends were black. But then one day, after about the fifth or sixth, or maybe it was the ninth or tenth black family moved into the neighborhood, Randy said she was moving. So I realized that she wasn't really talking about an eclipse. \"I did feel like an experiment, because people I didn't know in the neighborhood would stop and smile at me, and do all these kinds of things,\" she says. \"I could never trust that it was going to be real. Because as soon as I would get comfortable and trust, it would be shattered by a comment or a stare\" Karen Hutt: When it was 50%. Integration for a lot of white people-- I found it to be like one black family in the whole neighborhood, that's integration. For African-Americans, we like the idea of 50-50. That seemed about right. So when it got to be 50- 50, the integration dream was dashed. It was just gone. Karen Hutt: \"I was angry about losing the continuity of a community that I knew loved me\" \"I'm really proud about it now, because it was an exciting thing to be a part of,\" she says. \"Other than the political ramifications, I don't think I felt used\" Ira Glass: Karen Hutt was the first black child to integrate the Philadelphia public schools. She tells her church about the good things and the bad in her experience as a racial pioneer. Glass: The reaction she got from the congregation at the First Unitarian Church was sort of surprising. First Unitarian is this integrated church and was a hotbed of political activism. In the '60s and the '70s, they hid Black Panthers. Old Mayor Daley would send his Red Squad to wait outside the church in cars. Lots of people at the First Unitarian Church had been involved in various integration struggles. Laura Finnegan was one of two white children in her grade. She says that it was just as confusing for her as it was for Karen Hutt. It really created a lot of questions of who she was and who she should be, she says. \"I felt like, well, what is that ideal, and why are we here when I don't feel comfortable here all the time?\" he says. \"On other levels, that idea that we were betraying the integration was also just an excuse for other personal reasons for why we were staying in the neighborhood\" Richard Jennifer started working for theNewYorkTimesin the early '50s. His employer went to great lengths to ensure that he was able to perform his job without the usual racial barriers impeding his ability to work. \"Race was not really a real concern, because we all tended to go around, pal around, play around with each other on our off hours, as well as our working days,\" he says. Finley Campbell is a professor at DeVry University and an activist in the Progressive Labor Party. He was shot in Tupelo, Mississippi in 1978. Campbell: I am the black leader of the white folks. Because no one else wanted to reach out to the quote, \"rednecks,\" unquote. \"I'm eating dinner with Junior Osbourne and his wife Rosemary. And they bring out this stewed rabbit. It is so good. And I said, how did you learn how to cook rabbit black style? And he said, what do you mean, black style?\" Alex Poinsett grew up in Inglewood in the '20s and '30s. He says, among the people he knew, there was no real mixing. But he says some of his worst experiences were in college. He was obliged to sit-- the only black in a particular classroom. When I went to Illinois, you couldn't live in the dorms. And at Chicago, you could. that. People used to call this a Communist school in those days. They were always talking about the Communists, the Reds, at Chicago. Pauline Mccool was the first black member of the First Unitarian Church in Chicago. President of the board went to her father and said, \"Oh, well, it's all right if the people who come are like your daughter\" Her father was quite hurt and knew that she was so enthusiastic. Alex Poinsett joined the church after Pauline McCool. He says there was no concerted effort on the part of the church to \"integrate,\" in quotes, the liturgy. Whatever black spirituality you brought to the church you parked outside of the door. When civil rights began to emerge on the scene, there was a real effort to do things in an integrated way. That sort of integration says, you get like me, and whatever it is that is unique to you, you leave that behind. That's cultural suicide. I don't know whether it was due to the militancy of the blacks or whether the fact that the whites decided that it was too much trouble to be trying to do all these types of reaching-out things. They had enough to do in their own communities, with their own relationships and whatnot. But I think in the black mind, probably, the attitude was, look-- I guess the best way I can describe it is related to the church. Ira Glass: Your church is a kind of living history of people who have tried this accommodation stuff, as George Reed says. There are a lot of people there who have really tried to make integration work in their lives. Do they feel hopeful about integration? Do they think it's worth trying to do, given their experience? Finley Campbell: We can no longer talk about a mass integrationist process. It was short-circuited, to be blunt. So we've got to talk about integration moments. And not only have I seen them and experienced them, they fill me with hope. George Reed: \"I think maybe many people in the white community are running scared themselves\" He says whites have grown up in a society that condones bigotry in many respects. Reed: Even whites who are liberated from that, they still have that baggage that they have to deal with. Karen Hutt: \"It's going to take probably, even with the best intentions, a few generations to purge\" John Rice: In the outside world, he says, there's a lot of pressure on black people to be primarily identified only as black. One of the things, I think, that's made people in our church feel as if integration has worked is that people have substantial, authentic relationships with one another. I think the dream is still alive for many people, because of that church. Laura Finnegan: I came to the church at a point where I thought, I live in two different worlds still, and it's driving me crazy. Karen Hutt: I don't want to live in a world where we can only live in harmony if we live separately. It just doesn't feel right. Claudia Perez is an 18-year-old student at El Quarto Ano, an alternative high school. She was instrumental in convincing the City College's Board of Directors to reinstate the school's funding. She also talked about what the year was like in her own life. She said that her family has actually been pretty sad this year. Claudia Perez: \"If you have any good qualifications, like in doing anything, if you could finally get a scholarship, they'll help you. Anything. They're helping me try to get a savings bond from this thing called Latin something. And they give you at least $500\" Claudia Perez: \"My dad's not here. He wasn't here for Christmas or Thanksgiving\" \"I just know my dad is doing good. He'll be home soon\" \" Hispanic. They don't want you to succeed. That's the thing\" Claudia Perez hasn't seen her ex-boyfriend in three to four years. \"I've learned to take the pain of being let down by him,\" she says. \"When he calls me, I'm not going to jump to it no more\" Claudia Perez: I've stopped a lot of things for him. I could have been somewhere else instead of here. But I didn't because I would worry about where he was at, or what he was doing. So I came back. And now I'm just going to keep on walking. John Lennon: Have you been a little bit worried that possibly you might be going over the top fairly soon? Paul Mccartney: All the equipment's great. \"I Needed You Most\" by Marie: \"I Remember You, Homie\" The Beatles came out with these big TV documentaries and rare never-before-heard outtakes. This is number 130,862. It's stamped right here on the front. So it's, you know, a collector's item. The Fab Four basically come across as exhausted, irritated. They prattle on in a mundane way on obvious subjects. And they are no more glamorous, really, than you or me. They are exactly human scale. They have been rendered in human scale and not one inch bigger. Paul Mccartney: \"We stuck in a wilder number\" Ringo Starr: \"I kept saying to him, \"No that's not right. Not right. $100, that's right.\" You know? Man: \"Happy birthday, Ringo. Any good presents?\" Ira Glass: Other radio and television programs have spent much of the last week trying to summarize the past year. Glass: It's like trying to get a sense of the United States by flying across the country in a jet and looking out the window. Unusual stories of this, our American life, as always. Claudia Perez is an 18-year-old high school student from Little Village. Little Village is the neighborhood that most new Mexican immigrants come to. Chicago has more Mexicans than any other U.S. city except for Los Angeles. This is Claudia's first radio story. The loto men are on every other corner selling corn, cucumbers, tamales, Mexican antojitos. There's a parking lot at Church's Chicken where people meet up. The clock on it, donated by the Mexican government, stopped working a few weeks after it was installed. In the summer, people come to 26th Street and cruise around when they're bored. I talked to this girl in the record store about why girls come down here to cruise. There's a lot of cute guys. Sometimes it's sad because they're gang-bangers. But they're the finest ones. In 1995 the number of stores in the neighborhood actually increased 20%. The salesmen at Rossi Brothers had a good year. The discount mall is probably 40 or 50 stores packed into an old department store building. Spanish music and the Virgin of Guadalupe everywhere. Many Mexicans have done well in Chicago. Lots of them have moved away from this neighborhood to the suburbs. This woman said 80% of her customers this year were Mexicans. They worry that the Mexican merchants don't give them the best price. The staff of CJ's Clothing is almost all teenagers. One boy is 17, originally from Mexico, from Michoacan. He works but doesn't go to school. He says he misses his family in Mexico, but if he was there, he'd just be doing drugs. Ricardo summed up 1995 in one word: Boring. Ricardo's brother, Miguel, doesn't take him anywhere. Ricardo helped the police catch a thief at the discount mall. Miguel is a salesperson at CJ's. He's 19, has a goatee, is tall, [INAUDIBLE] complexion. In '96, Miguel will graduate from DeVry to become an electronic technician. Before long, he asks Claudia for her phone number. Miguel: Why don't you give me your number, and I'll call you too? And when you're famous, I'll be famous with you too. Claudia Perez: I'm going to write a book about me. I usually stop by at 12:00 or 1:00 in the morning. If I'm on a diet, I'll just drink a licuado de fresa instead of a torta. Man: \"I lied on my application. Because when they ask you, have you been convicted of felonies, I put no\" Man: \"It's because somebody went into the office and they kind of told on me or something\" Ira Glass finds two of the policemen who patrol 26th Street standing at a graphic design office. They say community policing is one of the main reasons crime rates are going down here. Now people are more willing to sign complaints and appear in court. Man: \"That was just a typical robbery. I mean, it could be dramatic to somebody else, or the person that got robbed. But to me, it's just an everyday occurrence for me\" Man: \"I bought a brand-new home. That's my dream, is to have my own house\" Ira Glass met a young couple who had a baby and a two-year-old daughter. He asked his wife if it was OK with her and she said yes. Mario Ramirez: \"Everything's been nice. We've got nice blessings this year\" Mario and Alice Ramirez's daughter called them a \"bad word\" at Christmas dinner. \"She just goes, hey, you-- and everyone started laughing, so it was nice,\" says Mario. \"Next year was going to be nicer,\" says Alice. Claudia Perez: This is a tape we bought at the discount mall. It's calledTracks areforKids. The song here is just to give you a little taste of what the Latinos in the South Side and everywhere else listen to. You, you, beloved listener, you be the judge. Lennon: \"Do you ever get irritated because you can't get above the noise of the people screaming at the shows?\" Mccartney: \"I don't know. Like what?\" Starr: \"It's marvelous\" Harrison: \"Have you met any interesting American girls?\" The story does involve this entire church, a historic church here in Chicago. Karen Hutt was the first black child to integrate the Philadelphia public schools. This was in the 1960s. And she talked about a very unusual experience that she had as a child. Karen Hutt: My friend Randy Goldstein moved to a white, Jewish neighborhood. She enrolled in the white public school there. She says she and her parents got to know each other real well. Karen: We were this perfect notion of how we were going to all live together in multicultural heaven. Karen Hutt says she felt like a guinea pig when her family moved to a new neighborhood. She says people would stop and smile at her, and say, \"It's getting a little dark around here\" Hutt: \"I realized that she wasn't really talking about an eclipse. It was probably about me\" Karen Hutt: When it was 50%. Integration for a lot of white people-- I found it to be like one black family in the whole neighborhood, that's integration. But for African-Americans, we like the idea of 50-50. That seemed about right. So when it got to be 50- 50, the integration dream was dashed. Karen Hutt: I was angry about losing the continuity of a community that I knew loved me. I'm really proud about it now, because it was an exciting thing to be a part of. But I'm smarter for it, I think. Karen Hutt: I don't think I felt used. Because you have to realize, too, my parents had a different kind of dream. They grew up in a fully segregated society. We were born into this revolution and to this dream and this hope. And they wanted to realize it in whatever way they could. After Karen Hutt gave a sermon about her experience as the first black child to integrate the Philadelphia public schools, lots of members of the congregation came to her. First Unitarian is this integrated church and was a hotbed of political activism. In the '60s and the '70s, they hid Black Panthers. Karen Hutt interviewed a young woman named Laura Finnegan. Laura's family was one of the few white families in South Shore, on the south side of Chicago. Laura describes it as just as just a confusing time. And sometimes she wished she were black so she could fit in better. When the violence in the neighborhood started to increase somewhat, we had been robbed at gunpoint. And we would ask my family, are we going to move? And they would say, well, yeah, maybe we'll move. And the feeling that was conveyed was, Well, if we move, then we're betraying this ideal of integration. Many people told you stories about somebody-- a boss or a coworker or a teacher or a friend-- who would look out for them. Let's play a little bit of that. One of the people that I interviewed was a gentleman named Richard Jennifer. He started working for theNewYorkTimesin the early '50s. Finley Campbell is a professor at DeVry University and an activist in the Progressive Labor Party. He's a civil rights activist that goes way back. days. He also was shot in Tupelo, Mississippi in 1978. He is very active in the social justice and environmental justice movement in our church. \"I am the-- pardon the expression-- the black leader of the white folks,\" he says. \"Here is this guy who had been my nightmare, the redneck, drawling, working-class, white man with his white wife. And we're sharing this rabbit, and it is so good\" Alex Poinsett grew up in Inglewood in the '20s and '30s. His first experience with integration was in high school. He says, among the people he knew, there was no real mixing. Blacks were just ignored. They stayed. Alex Poinsett says he was forced to tolerate a professor telling a \"nigger in the woodpile joke\" He says he walked away from the professor. Charlotte Lackner says people bought that black people were Communists or something. \"They were not people who were regular people,\" she says. When I went to Illinois, you couldn't live in the dorms. And at Chicago, you could. People used to call this a Communist school in those days. They were always talking about the Communists, the Reds, at Chicago. Alex Poinsett joined the church after Pauline McCool. His father was quite hurt and knew that I was so enthusiastic about this church. He told us that even though this pro-white faction left the church, it didn't really make that much of a difference. There was no concerted effort on the part of the church to \"integrate,\" in quotes, the liturgy. Whatever black spirituality you brought to the church you parked outside of the door. That sort of integration says, you get like me, and whatever it is that is unique to you, you leave that behind. That's cultural suicide. We were invited to innumerable homes and events and whatnot in the suburbs, which I hated to go to because I always got lost. But the people were wonderful. And we had wonderful experiences, and we developed some very good friendships. And then, it was sort of like a flash in the pan. This sort of thing kind of faded away. There was a sort of a meeting here at the church, downstairs in the basement. And I'll never forget that, because I was really upset and annoyed by the sort of cavalier attitude that many whites took. So I think something did happen, that blacks decided, OK, look, no more of this accomodation stuff. Karen Hutt: Do your church members feel hopeful about integration? Do they think it's worth trying to do, given their experience? Finley Campbell: Integration never has been given a chance to really get off the ground. We can no longer talk about a mass integrationist process. Karen Hutt: What do you say to people who think integration happened, and now we need to move into more segregated, separate kinds of worlds within the country?Finley Campbell: I say that many of those people never really experienced true down-home segregation. have I seen them and experienced them, they fill me with hope. I don't think that there is the sort of commitment in the white community as there was, earlier on, to trying to resolve it. Even whites who are liberated from that, they still have that baggage that they have to carry. It's something that's so subtle and pervasive that it's going to take probably a few generations to purge. In the outside world, he says, there's a lot of pressure on black people to be primarily identified only as black. So in that sense, this Unitarian society gave me that freedom. I can be the asshole that I want to be. And nobody says, that's that black asshole. They just say, That's John. He's who he is. Laura Finnegan: I came to the church at a point where I thought, I live in two different worlds still. I live on the North side, and I grew up on the South side. I swear to god they're still two different cities. And for me, I needed to reconcile that. Laura Finnegan: I don't want to live in a world where we can only live in harmony if we live separately. Karen Hutt: In a small way, I feel that burden too, because I want to be part of the same community. Claudia Perez was instrumental in convincing the City College's Board of Directors to reinstate the funding. Their funding was threatened and they were going to have to close. She decided her school should put out a newspaper, and so she put one out. She wanted to interview Luis Rodriguez, the local poet and author. Claudia Perez is a junior at a high school in California. She says she's been up and down this year. Her dad is not in the U.S. for Christmas or Thanksgiving. She's trying to get a savings bond. Claudia Perez: \"I've learned to take the pain of being let down by him\" \"I haven't seen him for probably about three months, maybe,\" she says of her ex-boyfriend. \"I wanted to cry, but it was just, like, there's no more tears left\" Claudia Perez: I've been waiting a long time. I've stopped a lot of things for him. I could have been somewhere else instead of here. But I didn't. So I came back. And now I'm just going to keep on walking. Claudia Perez: \"He'll always be in my heart forever\" \"I Remember You, Homie\" by MC Blvd. Marie. \"I Needed You Most\" by Marie. WBEZ: \"We broadcast proudly from Chicago\" Lennon: Have you been a little bit worried that possibly you might be going over the top fairly soon? Lennon: No.\n",

            " This American Life is produced for the ear and designed to be heard. If you are able, we strongly encourage you to listen to the audio, which includes emotion and emphasis that's not on the page. Transcripts are generated using a combination of speech recognition software and human transcribers. This American Life is your weekly program documenting everyday life in these United States through whatever means and tactics seem necessary. Today, what we're going to do is devote the entire program to just one thing, to this very unusual set of comic monologues. These recordings were made between October of 1994 and August of 1995 at a regular weekly comedy show called Un-Cabaret in Los Angeles. Act One, Julia's Brother Gets Cancer. Act Two, Julia is diagnosed with cancer herself and gets treated. Julia Sweeney was in the cast ofSaturday Night Live. She's best known for a character named Pat. Her brother moved in with her when he got cancer to be near the cancer treatment center. A lot of the stories that Julia Sweeney tells about cancer are basically just stories about her family. Julia Sweeney's parents are staying with her this week. Her brother, who's the fourth child, got lymph cancer. \"It's a very tragic, terrible situation, although he's doing very well,\" she says. \"Oh, please be with me tonight. Hold for laughs,\" she adds. \"I can't really yell at them for the small, annoying things that they do,\" he says. \"Yet, for you, I can kvetch a little bit\" \"Every time we get on an elevator, she acts like it's a miracle invention,\" he adds. \"How many millions of times have we been on elevators together? A billion,\" he says. \"My mother, she's from that generation that thinks that you would never get a second opinion about anything,\" he adds. \"And also, she believes that all doctors have the same amount of knowledge in every area\" \"I really don't think a gynecologist who's been retired for 20 years is going to know that much about this,\" she says. \"OK, who left their syringes on the kitchen table? Dad? We have to throw them away and break the needle.\" Mike is doing really great and is responding really well to the treatment, but he's had so many spinal taps that they can't get into his spinal column anymore. A doctor says, \"We're thinking about putting a shunt in your head\" Mike: \"I'm already 90 pounds and I have no hair. I am not going to walk around for a year with a faucet sticking of my forehead\" \"I got a little depressed that [INAUDIBLE]. So Thursday night, I decided that I wanted-- because, as you may know, The Pope wrote a book, and it came out on Thursday. And also, I wanted to get away from my home\" \"If I am going to end and I really am just going to be over, why can't I smoke? Because who cares if I get lung cancer? I'm not going live that long to even have lung cancer,\" he says. \"So I'm going to buy some cigarettes. Yes! I'mgoing to buy a cigarette\" \"I'm thinking, \"The Pope's doing some business on these books.\" So I go over to this area, and it's that Resnick Nicole Simpson book. So then I go back, and I go, \"No, not the Resnick book. The Pope's book\" And then I think, oh, I don't really want to just buy ThePope's book,\" he says. \"I let out the biggest fart. thing I'll ever say at Un-Cabaret-- without any warning,\" he says. \"It's like a whistle has gone off at Book Soup. It's just like everyone looks up\" So I put back the atheist book, because I really thought my book is really The Agnostic'sGuidetoGetting Through the Day. \"Just because no one saw it, that means it's a bomb? It's a hit to me.\" And he goes, \"Oh, well anyway, I'm sorry.\" So I'm smoking, and I'm really happy. And then finally, I'm getting close to home, so I throw the cigarette out. Then I keep driving, and all of a sudden, I smell this really smoky smell. And I turn around, and my back seat is on fire. Julia Sweeney: \"An old man smoking a cigarette threw it out of his car\" \"I had the passenger window open where he would be on the other side of the-- because-- yes. And I noticed him, that creep.\" \"Well, Sunset Boulevard, you know.\" Julia Sweeney: My parents are staying with me because I have a brother who is very ill with cancer. \"It's like, how could I really scream at my mother for talking incessantly when her son is so very ill?\" Sweeney: \"We don't know if we should yell at him about the drugs, but then he has cancer\" \"I am going to try my [BLEEP] hardest to make this funny, all right? So I go seeHouseGuestbecause I'm going to see Phil Hartman next week, and I want to have seen it\" \"I kept thinking all the way home, what are the scenes I can say you were funny in? Which scene?\" \"It's too bad, but I guess it's making money\" Having your parents in your house means having a lot of trouble, he says. \"There's no cat food,\" his mom says, \"and I was going to try, but I was making some soup, and your father is too drunk to deal with it\" \"There's just this sound everywhere. every available audio device going in every room\" \"There's nothing like being a single woman in her 30s buying $15 of cat food at midnight\" \"The cats were so hungry that I gave them the dry food they hate and they won't eat it\" \"I am really willing to just toss caution to the wind and throw this cat food away,\" she says. \"And then, of course, we pull it apart. Cat food goes flying all over the kitchen,\" she adds. \"There's little pieces of cat food everywhere, landing in the soup\" \"I love that music because I just love Gershwin,\" she says. \"I don't even anymore-- like, 10 years ago, I would've said, \"Gersh WIN isn't gospel or blues!\" But now, I just go, \"Oh, I know. Go to the House of Blues. They got it.\" \"I'm just thinking of her in Japan crying about these [BLEEP]NationalGeographicsubscriptions that no one even wants,\" she says. \"I've always had this thing where, like my mom-- it started with my mom,\" she adds. \"Obviously, our tastes and tastes and Obviously, our taste and tastes\" \"I have this mental thing, like I always am trying to be better than some experience in my past,\" he says. \"So my brother, they don't know-- now the cancer, they keep taking tests, and the cancer gets less and less\" Ira Glass: My mom keeps going, \"We need to do an intervention with him on the drugs\" Glass: But I realized I was walking around this week thinking, \"You know, when I have cancer, I am going to act so much better\" Ira Glass: We are devoting an entire hour to these unusual recordings-- sort of part comedy, part diary-- about cancer. This is Julia Sweeney recorded at Un-Cabaret in Los Angeles. In this act, Julia gets diagnosed with cancer herself. Julia Sweeney was diagnosed with cervical cancer about a month ago. \"It's not life-threatening and I'm totally fine,\" she says. \"My parents, who are staying with me way too long, then I got cervical cancer,\" she adds. \"I feel I wouldn't have chosen to have a hysterectomy, I guess,\" she says. \"I kind of feel about my reproductive organs like a bicycle that I've had in the garage, this really great bike that I just never used\" \"I don't feel that sad about it,\" she says of having a hysterectomy. \"That's right, because now my worth as a woman has been taken away from me\" \"I'll just do two more little cancer bits before I'm done\" \"I'm learning all about these biological things-- because the ovaries are the things that make you lubricate when you're aroused,\" she says. \"If I wanted to have a child surrogately, I could have it. So that was fine. They saved those\" \"We're just kind of dating, but--\" \"How many different sperm people can I have?\" \"Well, the start-up costs are kind of high, but you could have five or six\" \"It's like, \"If you're nice enough to me, you can have one of my eggs\" Julia Sweeney had a hysterectomy and is now having radiation. She had her vagina tattooed to say \"aim the beams here\" \"I'm on the gazillionth percentile of making it,\" she says of her chances of survival. \"I was a little scared. But they're saying, \"Oh, no. It'll hurt, but who cares\" or something like that,\" she says. \"Then, all of a sudden, he's going like this, and then he goes, \"I think I think my vagina is getting a tattoo\" \"The best one is when Pat went to the barber.\" \"I think the kicker is now that Pat has cervical cancer, we know what--\" This is so personal. I can't even believe I'm telling you guys this, but I guess that's the whole point of Un-Cabaret\" The actress says she was told she would have to undergo a three-hour procedure. The procedure would involve an IV of Valium, she says. \"I kind of feel bad because they really were trying to push the visualization,\" she says of the procedure. Julia Sweeney was diagnosed with cervical cancer in 1995. She returned to Un-Cabaret to continue her treatment. Sweeney: \"I have this thing where the clothes in my closet don't know that I have cancer\" \" visualization is my hobby and my expertise,\" she says. Julia Sweeney was diagnosed with a rare type of cancer. The slides of her cells were shipped over to another doctor's hospital. She went to fetch the slides herself. She says she didn't know where she was going, but eventually found the doctor. Julia Sweeney has been diagnosed with a rare form of cancer. She says she found the slides of her cancer treatment in an Asian man's office. The man said, \"You're the person in these slides?\" And she said, 'Yeah, those slides are me' \"It's kind of hilarious that I just have no symptoms. It seems like all of the problems have been coming from the cure of this, but not from the actual cancer,\" she says. \"There's only 50 women in the world, and none of them have died from it.\" Ira Glass had a different kind of really rare cervical cancer, but not that specific kind. Glass: I don't think they ever really told that guy, because this week, he called me up. He was just so happy to be with me, like, meeting this woman who had the cancer. Julia Sweeney: I got a little cancer. And I did surgery, and I did radiation. And my last radiation was on Wednesday. And so now I can't say I have cancer anymore, which I have to say, I will totally cop to the fact that I'm kind of missing that. Julia Sweeney survived her cancer and turned these monologues from Un-Cabaret into a one-woman show calledGodSaid,\"Ha!\" She put it out as a book. Quentin Tarantino turned it into a movie that you can still get on DVD. This interview was taped before Julia knew that she had cancer. When this was recorded, her brother was still alive, and family was really struggling. \"My brother leaves the room and starts smoking,\" Julia says. \"And he is D-R-U-N-K,\" her brother responds. \"I went to Pavilions, and I ran into this couple from the Balkans. And your father was reading that book. And then I couldn't find the change for the ten, and then the car, and so--\" \"Did you know about Adam the Impaler, who impaled people?\" \"Oh, no.\" \"Every major war is started in the Balkans,\" she says. \"Married people who visit me must sleep together. I do not have enough beds for them\" \"I'd better go quick because this is so sad-- so I go into the bedroom\" \"You must overcome your feelings and just sleep in the same bed. Go in after he's fallen asleep, and get up before he wakes up\" \"You know, he was a drunk. In real life, too.\" \"And Gloria Grahame.\" Ira Glass: Julia Sweeney has been working on a new one-woman show, that we've actually excerpted onThisAmericanLifealready, calledLettingGoofGod. Next month, she plans to put out that show on CD. There's a book in the works, more live performances, the whole schmear. This American Life is on the web at www.thisamericanlife.org.

There's something about these original recordings that she made. During the same weeks that some of the most horrible things that can happen to a person were happening to her. Sometimes you get the feeling that she's talking about these things for the very first time with anybody. And it's from a stage. These recordings were made between October of 1994 and August of 1995 at a regular weekly comedy show called Un-Cabaret in Los Angeles. No comic was allowed to tell a story that he or she had ever told on stage before. So spontaneity was just built into the structure of it. Julia Sweeney was in the cast ofSaturday Night Livefor a while. She's best known for a character named Pat. There was a Pat movie, which, as she refers to, didn't really do too well. Sometimes you're going to hear laughing and off-stage comments during the monologues. Julia Sweeney's brother got lymph cancer and her parents moved in with her. Sweeney says it's a special feeling to be in your mid-30s and have your parents moving in with you. \"It's just the first of many weeks,\" she says. \"I am with my parents, but in a very trying situation,\" he says. \"Every time we get on an elevator, she acts like it's a miracle invention\" \"I can't really yell at them for the small, annoying things that they do,\" he adds. \"Every time, she goes, \"Oh, oh!\" when the elevator arrives,\" he says. \"How many millions of times have we been on elevators together? A billion,\" he adds. \"Hurry up because the doors are going to close automatically!\" \"I really don't think a gynecologist who's been retired for 20 years is going to know that much about this,\" she says. \"OK, but you wonder, what's Dad doing? He reads. He just buries himself in reading\" A doctor says he's thinking about putting a shunt in Mike's head. \"A shunt, like an artificial opening to the brain,\" the doctor says. \"Well, the best place we've found is to put it in the forehead,\" he adds. \"I'm already 90 pounds and I have no hair. I am not going to walk around for a year with a faucet sticking of my forehead,\" he says. \"The people we know, the patients that have the shunt, they love it,\" the doctor says. \"I just don't want to go on. And if I am going to end and I really am just going to be over, why can't I smoke? Because who cares if I get lung cancer? I'm not going live that long to even have lung cancer\" \"I was looking for a big 10-foot cutout of The Pope with his hands out and the book. There wasn't one,\" he says. \"So I go over and I get the Pope's Book, this book. And then I think, oh, I don't really want to just buy The Pope's book\" Julia Stiles: I let out the biggest fart. And it's like a whistle has gone off at Book Soup. It's just like everyone looks up. And I don't how whether to rush out of that area or look around or-- it was terrible. \"They opened it in Houston and Seattle, and nobody went or liked it. So, I don't know.\" \"Just because no one saw it, that means it's a bomb? It's a hit to me\" \"I put back the atheist book, because I really thought my book is really The Agnostic'sGuidetoGetting Through the Day\" \"This was just such a horrific situation that you could only feel better. You just had to go up. across the street, I buy a pack of cigarettes. So now I'm really going to enjoy myself,\" she says. \"And then I keep driving, and all of a sudden, I smell this really smoky smell. And then I pull into the driveway, and I turn around, and my back seat is on fire\" \"I was driving down Sunset, and this old man smoking a cigarette threw it out of his car,\" she says. \"I had the passenger window open where he would be on the other side of the-- because-- yes. And I noticed him, that creep.\" Julia Sweeney's parents are staying with her because she has a brother who is very ill with cancer. \"Their annoying qualities, their personalities, are heightened because it's a crisis situation,\" she says. \"It's like, how could I really scream at my mother for talking?\" \"I am going to try my [BLEEP] hardest to make this funny, all right? So I go seeHouseGuestbecause I'm going to see Phil Hartman next week, and I want to have seen it\" \"I kept thinking all the way home, what are the scenes I can say you were funny in? Which scene?\" \"It's too bad, but I guess it's making money\" \"I was wondering howHouseGuestwas because I like Sinbad. And I like him because I watched him on TV. And the TV in the living room doesn't coordinate with the cable anymore\" \"I was going to try, but I was making some soup, and the soup started boiling over\" Having your parents in your house means having every available audio device going in every room. So there's just this sound everywhere. And then \"meow, meowing, meow\" of the cats. \"There's nothing like being a single woman in her 30s buying $15 of cat food\" \"The cats were so hungry that I gave them the dry food they hate, and they won't eat it\" \"I am really willing to just toss caution to the wind and throw this cat food away,\" he says. \"Cat food goes flying all over the kitchen\" \"I get the cat food out, I break it up, I put it down, and aaaaagh! And then, at that moment-- So I go, OK, I'll just pick up my messages,\" she says. \"Oh, I'm terribly sorry. We've mixed up your results with someone else\" \"I'm just thinking of her in Japan crying about these [BLEEP]NationalGeographicsubscriptions that no one even wants\" \"I, by the way, am one of the recipients. So isn't it great that I have to get the magazine and know all these trauma and subterfuge that goes on?\" \"I've always had this thing where, like my mom-- it started with my mom. Obviously, our tastes and everything were different,\" he says. \"So I have this mental thing, like I always am trying to be better than some experience in my past\" \"I realized I was walking around this week thinking, \"You know, when I have cancer, I am going to act so much better,\" she says. \"I don't think so. But I realize the most [BLEEP] up thing is-- oh, just one other thing. Act Two: Julia Gets Cancer. This is Julia Sweeney recorded at Un-Cabaret in Los Angeles. In this act, Julia gets diagnosed with cancer herself. How to make jokes about your own cancer and actually get laughs, an onstage demonstration. Julia Sweeney was diagnosed with cervical cancer about a month ago. \"I wake up debating how and if I should bring that up,\" she says. \"The thing is, it's not life-threatening and I'm totally fine\" \"I'm kind of happy for the experience,\" Sweeney says. \"I feel I wouldn't have chosen to have a hysterectomy, I guess,\" she says. \"I kind of feel about my reproductive organs like a bicycle that I've had in the garage, this really great bike that I just never used\" \"I feel like fate is saying to me, \"OK, we're taking away your bicycle. You can never ride a bike again.\" And so then you think, \"god, I was really going to ride that bike\" But it's not like the end of the world. It's like, well, there's a lot of other things. \"You can skate. And it's there. I have a garage for it\" \"I'm like, \"Get me to the hospital!\" Really? Aaagh! So I'm in the hospital. And they save my ovaries, which I guess is a good thing-- I'm learning all about these biological things,\" she says. \"I feel like I have this dance card with 12 eggs on it,\" she says. \"If you're nice enough to me, you can have one of my eggs\" \"I just decided that it's just too weird. So I didn't do that\" Julia Sweeney had her ovary surgically removed in 1995. A month later, her doctor told her that the ovary had died. She asked, \"Am I going to cough?\" He said, \"Sometimes, ovaries, when they're cut off from their responsibilities, go traveling\" \"I'm on the gazillionth percentile of making it. But it doesn't mean that I don't have to have eight weeks of radiation\" \"I was a little scared. So mine's kind of a really sensitive spot. So we're spending some time\" \"My vagina is getting a tattoo,\" she says. \"I can't even believe I'm telling you guys this, but I guess that's the whole point of Un-Cabaret, even though it'll make you uncomfortable\" \"I just find it so funny that it was hard not to laugh,\" she adds. \"It's sick, because the light in this doctor's eyes when he talks about how this is the cutting edge of technology, it scares me,\" she says. \"I really feel like that's the point of it is that they get to do this to me\" Ira Glass has a thing where the clothes in her closet don't know that she has cancer. She has to tell them when she puts her clothes on. Glass: \"I am very good at visualizing. I'm an actress and visualization is my hobby and my expertise\" Julia Sweeney played a woman with a rare type of cervical cancer. She went to fetch slides of her cells from a doctor who was studying the disease. Sweeney: \"I didn't know where I was going. All I knew is his name was Dr. Fu\" Julia Sweeney was looking for the Julia Sweeney cancer slides. She knocked on Dr. Fu's door, and he said, \"You're the person in these slides?\" \"Yeah, those slides, that's me. And I want them. Give them back!\" \"It's kind of hilarious that I just have no symptoms. It seems like all of the problems have been coming from the cure of this, but not from the actual cancer,\" she says. \"He wanted to know if I'd been on birth control pills, because that's what he thinks it is\" \"I found out a few weeks later, after the slides went back, that I didn't have that cancer. I had a different kind of really rare cervical cancer, but not that specific kind\" \"I don't think they ever really told that guy, because this week, he called me up\" Julia Sweeney: I got a little cancer. And I did surgery, and I did radiation. And my last radiation was on Wednesday. And so now I can't say I have cancer anymore, which I have to say, I will totally cop to the fact that I'm kind of missing that. Julia Sweeney had her last radiation treatment on Wednesday. \"Don't you mean to tell me I'm in remission?\" she asks. Sweeney turned monologues from Un-Cabaret into a one-woman show calledGodSaid,\"Ha!\" This is taped before Julia knew that she had cancer. When this was recorded, her brother was still alive, and family was really struggling. Julia put it out as a book. Quentin Tarantino turned it into a movie that you can still get on DVD. \"I just walk out of the house and go to the office where my dad is,\" he says. \"Oh, hi. I borrowed this book off your shelf--TheBalkanGhost,which is all travel\" \"My brother leaves the room and starts smoking pot in the other room,\" his mom says. \"I'm leaving him. But I'm not leaving your house, and neither is he,\" she says. \"It means I am not sleeping in the guest room with him anymore. I need another place to go\" \"Every major war is started in the Balkans,\" her father says. \"Married people who visit me must sleep together,\" he says. \"I do not have enough beds for people to break up while they're visiting me\" \"In aLonelyPlaceis starting at 5:00 in the morning. Irony\" Julia Sweeney has been working on a new one-woman show. Next month, she plans to put out that show on CD. She's got plans to film that show. There's a book in the works, more live performances, the whole schmear. If today's program has made you curious about Un-Cabaret, they have audio downloads, greatest hits CDs and live shows.

And the fake names they chose, you ready? K-Rad, Mr. Warez, and Fred. Those first two names come from the world of computer hacking and software piracy. Mr. Warez, for example, that's \"warez,\" as in \"wares,\" as in \"softwares,\" as in pirated softwares, illegal softwares. And as for Fred--FredWhy Fred? For no reason, man. There's got to be someone else named Fred out there.Ira GlassYou see, anonymity was important given the kinds of things that we were discussing, namely credit card fraud, computer hacking, and the nature of hell. Well, from WBEZ in Chicago, this isYourRadioPlayhouse.I'm Ira Glass. Today on our playhouse stage, small-scale stories of small-scale sin. Stay with us, won't you?So K-Rad, Mr. Warez, and Fred were trying to be criminals. But they were not too successful at this. And at a McDonald's on Times Square in New York City, they told all. Doesn't that have a nice,HardCopysound to it? \"They told all.\"This was kind of an unpleasant McDonald's. Because it was in Times Square, they decided to have neon lights everywhere in this place. A crush of sweaty people at the counter, tourists, most of us. It was the middle of summer. Fred took charge.FredWhat do you guys want?K-radI want a number one meal.FredOK, I'm paying for this. You're paying for my cab, OK? Whatever I can pay for. OK, we'll have a number one meal.Ira GlassThey're actually in Manhattan for a computer hackers' convention this summer, and Fred was not used to the downtown prices.FredOh my god. It's $5, man. You guys are chipping in. I can't pay for this.Ira GlassI think it's fair to say that one sign that your criminal career is not going so well is if you have to worry about the prices at McDonald's. But K-Rad, Mr. Warez, and Fred were involved in very low-level types of crimes. All of them involve computers. They pirated software. They scammed free CD-ROM games. They cheated one of the big online computer services out of a few hundred dollars in online time.All in all, they didn't steal very much. And they didn't steal very effectively. But they did try to steal. Take this phone scam, where they would call people at random and try to get a calling card number or a credit card number out of them.K-radBasically, the way it works is this. You call up somebody. You say, \"This is the AT&T operator. I have a priority collect call for--\" so-and-so's name. And the whole point is you have to sound like you're not calling somebody up with the intention of getting them. You have to sound like you've been sitting in this chair for 10 hours, and you want to go home.So you got to go, \"This is the AT&T operator. I have a collect call for Paul. Will you accept charges, sir?\" \"Uh, yeah. I'll accept charges.\" \"All right, hold on one second.\"Then you tap on the keyboard. You say, \"I'm sorry. You seem to have a restriction on your phone line. You can't accept collect calls to this line.\" And then they yell, and they go, \"What do you mean, I can't accept collect calls to my line? I've been getting collect calls to this line for 20 years.\"And then, you've got to go, \"Sir, there's nothing I can do about it. My computer says you can't receive a collect call on this line. Would you like to try an alternate billing method?\" In which case they will proceed to either give you a calling card or a major credit card.Ira GlassAnd that, of course, is the idea behind the whole thing, to end up with a calling card number or a credit card number that is not your own, that you can use yourself. Now I should say that before you go out and try this yourselves, if you are thinking about doing this yourself right now, I should tell you one important fact. It doesn't work.K-radThe reason it doesn't work is because a good percentage of people, after the point at which they go through the mind-boggling experience of not understanding what it means to have a restriction on your line, because nobody knows what that means, then they'll just say, \"Oh, this is too much trouble. Forget it. I won't accept the collect call.\"Ira GlassThe other scams these guys run don't do much better. They tried to hack their way into the mainframe system of a big computer retailer. But they were caught and stopped before they got very far. They are such unaccomplished computer hackers that Fred himself was actually the victim of computer hackers twice. Someone broke into Fred's account on one computer bulletin board and used his account and his electronic mail to visit some of the nether regions of the net.FredRemember, you talked to the guy on IRC. There's this weird guy. This guy was going on all these sex channels. And he was wrecking my name and stuff. It was awful.K-radYou can't get pissed at him. I wouldn't get pissed at him, because that would be entirely hypocritical. I've said that if anybody ever steals one of my credit cards or ever hacks into my account or computer system, I will not care. And I will be perfectly allowable to that.To go and say, \"I can't believe it. Somebody took my credit card.\" Well, so what if I did it to everyone else? I'm perfectly willing to let someone do that to me.Ira GlassOver the summer was when they really started to get serious about using other people's credit cards, which they call \"carding.\" They met a guy who was good at this and who taught them some tricks. K-Rad and Fred ordered $1,600 in computer merchandise on someone else's credit card. They had it delivered to a neutral address. They picked it up. They sold half of it for cash.And one thing that's peculiar about this story is that these are rich kids. K-Rad and Fred live in a wealthy upstate community. They attend what is one of the most expensive, prestigious private schools in the country. But they steal.Fred believes that he has no choice. He really suffers over money. He's this skinny, young-looking 15-year-old. And he is perpetually strapped for cash. And he said that his parents couldn't help him much with money right now because they had just gone $500,000 into debt.FredBecause they bought a house right before the depression and stuff. The recession, excuse me. I consider it a depression. I've noticed the effects.Ira GlassAt one point, to get some cash, he actually sold the computer that his parents had bought for him. And I don't think they knew. His idea is that he wanted to replace the computer as quickly as he could with the help of a stranger's credit card.And he also wanted to get all the other things that the other kids at his expensive private school had. He wanted to have a microwave. He wanted to have a stereo. Basically, he just wanted to be like everybody else.FredI'm also pretty good at shoplifting. But my whole thing on that is that I will not steal anything if I have the money for it. And a lot of times, like the store at my school, like the grill, I steal from that a lot. But I also give them $10 for no reason if I have the money because I feel bad about what I've stolen. And if I ever get the money so I don't have to do this shit anymore, then I'm not going to do it.Ira GlassWhat's striking about this is how these boys want to convince themselves-- I think they really do-- want to convince themselves that they are good, and that what they do does not harm anyone. And if it does harm someone, there's always the reassuring thought that they keep very near at hand that someday they can make it up to the injured party.K-radAs noble as this sounds, this is one thing that I absolutely guarantee that sounds like the biggest load of crap anyone could ever say. But if I am ever in a financial--Mr. WarezWe believe in you.K-radNo, no one should believe in me. This is the biggest \"I'm really good inside.\" If I ever find myself-- and I've made this vow to myself-- in a good enough financial situation, I will repay everything I have ever done now. If I find myself making $2 million a year, I will send a $10,000 check to the company which I stole calling cards from. That is something I definitely want to do if I am in the financial situation to do it.Ira GlassK-Rad told me that the $1,600 that they charged to a stranger's Visa card was, in fact, a victimless crime, that the card owner would call Visa, have the charge removed from his bill. And that Visa figures a certain amount of fraud is just the cost of doing business.K-radOne thing that I've always said in all my doings is that I will never, ever do something that will severely hurt an individual person. OK? So for example, if it involves-- I would never mug someone. I would never beat someone up for money. I'd never shoplift. Well, maybe I-- no, I wouldn't shoplift.Ira GlassThat's one of my favorite parts of the interview. Hold on. I'm just going to play that tape back. Because you can actually hear him-- he's struggling so much, you can actually hear him working it out out loud. Hold on, I'm just going to rewind for a second.[TAPE REWINDING]K-rad--never beat someone up for money. I'd never shoplift. Well, maybe I-- no, I wouldn't shoplift. Because that is hurting the individual person.Ira GlassSee what I mean? So we headed out of the McDonald's and back to the hotel where the computer hackers' convention was taking place. On the way, without any prompting at all, Fred elaborated on the idea that he was only stealing because he absolutely had to.FredI go to boarding school. And I don't have that much-- I don't have any money or anything. And I get really hungry and stuff. I have a fast metabolism. And seriously, I starve. And I lost 10 pounds in one week. And that's not good for someone who's really skinny, like I am. And then a lot of it is just stuff I want, you know?And yeah, I just really want to stress that in other ways, we're not bad people. And we don't go around trying to screw all people in any way we can. Because we're not at all.I mean, I do social work. I tutored kids. I do a lot of stuff which isn't necessarily evil and more good. But sometimes, it's just like, I don't know, man. I like doing it. I can't explain it.Ira GlassTalk about that part of it. What is the thrill of doing it?FredThat's the first-- that was the reason I started carding. The reason was the thrill of going. When we went in there, it was likeMission:Impossible.We went in. We had gloves on and stuff. And we picked it up. We had it all worked out. We were connected. We had lookouts and stuff. And it's just a lot of fun. It's like you're doing stuff that is not exactly legal, not legal at all. And it's fun.Ira GlassBy this point, we were back in the hotel lobby. We took the elevators up to the floor where the hackers' convention was taking place. K-Rad said that real hackers do not use their skills like this. They do not use their skills for personal gain. They don't do carding. They don't steal.The whole idea of computer hacking, for these guys anyway, is that it's a kind of pure, zen pursuit. It's an ends in itself. You break into the computer for its own sake and to look around, and for the knowledge of everyone, especially you.We stood in the hallway. People streamed by. We tried to move to a corner where we would not be overheard. And K-Rad said, actually, that they had never really talked about their illegal activities this much before with anyone.K-radThe most thing I'm worried about is I'm actually starting, for the first time, to say this all out loud, everything I've done. And suddenly, it doesn't sound as hacker, much, anymore. And I've known that ever since I moved into doing maybe some credit card thing. And that's why I'm, in fact, even considering giving up on doing all the carding and stuff like that, which seriously, I am.Ira GlassFred then shot him this look. Because if K-Rad were serious, and they did stop carding, Fred would not be able to get a computer to replace the old one that his parents gave him.FredWhat about my computer?K-radWhat?Mr. WarezYour computer will come first.FredJesus Christ, man. I want to get a gun and shoot you.K-radAll right, after your computer.Ira GlassThe thing about a bad conscience is that it splits you in half. And Fred said that he had two different modes. That was the word he used, \"modes.\" He said that sometimes he would think about what they were doing. And he knew it was wrong, and it would bother him. But mostly, he tried not to think about it.FredMy worst fear is that I can end up going to hell for doing this. And that's my worst fear.Ira GlassDo you believe in hell?FredYeah, I do.Ira GlassAnd you think you can go to hell for getting a computer on somebody else's credit card?FredI don't know. I hope not. I really hope not. It's always been my biggest fear. That's why I'm afraid of dying. I'm afraid if there's something I've done which just is like the straw on the camel's back, that's going to be what's going to do it.Ira GlassHow big is this worry? Will this keep you up at night?FredYeah, maybe for a couple minutes. And then I just sort of put it out of my mind, you know?Ira GlassHis share of the carding profits was $800. I told him that from an adult's perspective, this did not seem like a lot of money. I didn't think you could do eternity in hell for $800.And as soon as I said this, I really regretted it. Fred's body language changed completely. It was like I was calling him a little kid. It was like saying that he was ridiculous to worry over something so small. It was just one of these moments. He got quieter, and he kind of pulled into himself a little bit.Then Mr. Warez spoke up. He said that sure, maybe by adult standards, this wasn't much money. But to them, it was a lot, that it was plenty enough to count.When is hell a possibility? Whenever you think it is, it is. More on this when our program continues.Act One: Act OneIra GlassWell, this isYourRadioPlayhouse. Now a little radio experiment. We told a Chicago playwright named Jeff Dorchen what K-Rad, Fred, and Mr. Warez said about hell and about sin and about their own relative badness in this world. And we asked Jeff Dorchen to write an original radio play that would pick up the themes where the boys leave off. So here's what he came up with.CalebI'll call.DondiMe too.CalebThree 10's.PeterFull house, aces and eights.CalebOoh. What do you got, kid?DondiFour diamonds.CalebYou got nothing.PeterSee, if you had some where the numbers matched, or if they were in order, and there were five of them. But that, what you have there, that's nothing.CalebMy grandpa used to call that a kangaroo straight.PeterMy dad used to call it a Klondike.DondiKlondike wins the game.CalebNo, Klondike doesn't win the game. Peter wins the game. Full house wins.DondiI hate you, Peter.PeterI don't blame you.[WAILING]DondiGrandmother, be careful. Grazie.PeterMy deal. Straight, five card draw.CalebAnything wild?PeterNo.Dondi[UNINTELLIGIBLE]CalebShut up. Ow. Watch it with those cards, man.PeterSorry.CalebWhat's your problem today?DondiHe has sinned.PeterYeah-- yes, I have. How did you know?DondiYour eyes. They are the eyes of an accused man, furtive, alert, the eyes of a nervous beast who, once a lover of gambols and jigs and standard metals, has been driven to nocturnal skulking by the pursuit of a relentless predator.CalebHe's got you there. 10,000 lira.DondiCall.PeterCall. Caleb, do you believe in sin?CalebHell, no. I believe in damnation, though.PeterHow can you believe in damnation but not sin?CalebPredestiny. Take me. I was born damned. I'm cowardly, petty, intolerant, lazy, and just generally destructive. I knew I was damned the first time I heard the word.DondiYour Calvinism relieves you of the responsibility for improving yourself.CalebShut up, kid.[SLAP]DondiOw!PeterWhat are you doing?DondiIt's all right, GI Joe. I am strong.CalebYeah, Pete. The kid can take it. Now give me three.PeterHow many, Dondi?DondiFour.PeterYou can't have four. The most you can have is three.DondiOK. I'll take two.PeterAnd two for the dealer.Caleb5,000.DondiCall.PeterCall. What do you have?CalebA pair of 9's. Dondi?DondiThree onions.CalebThose are spades, not onions. And you're supposed to match the numbers, not the suit, you little spaghetti sucker.DondiI have a Klondike.CalebYou have garbage. How many times do we have to go through this? It's like rolling a boulder up a hill just to have it roll back down again, over and over and over.DondiI will not make the mistake again, sahib.CalebDon't call me sahib. Peter, what do you have? A pair of jacks. All right. Pair of jacks takes it. All right. Seven card stud poker, one-eyed royalty, red deuces, nines, and all odd-numbered clubs are wild.PeterWhat do you guys think the worst sin is? Murder?DondiBetrayal.PeterWhy do you say that?DondiAt the center of the ninth and innermost frozen circle of hell, Lucifer devours Judas eternally.PeterReally?DondiThat's what they say. One million lira.PeterI'll see that and raise you one.CalebCall.DondiI'm there.CalebWhat do you got?DondiSeven aces.PeterMe too.CalebSo do I. All right, so there were a few too many wild cards. Let's hold the pot over.DondiOK. Peter?PeterHuh? Oh, sure. Leave it over. Do you think a sin is worse if say you, for example, you betray somebody? Then suppose you don't feel any remorse. Does that make it worse?DondiOf course. Gentlemen, the game is Chicago low. Ace, no face, sevens, follow the queen.PeterWait a second, Dondi. Caleb, could I talk to you alone for a second, over there, by the window?CalebSure, Pete.DondiI will go fetch us some delicious ginger ale.CalebGood idea. What is it, Pete? Think the kid's trying to hustle us?PeterNo, I just wanted to talk, that's all.CalebWhat's the matter?PeterNothing. Just I'm afraid of going to hell.CalebWhat? Why?PeterI just don't think I'm a very good person.CalebThat's ridiculous, Pete. You're a very nice guy. You write letters. I never write letters.PeterYeah, but what if you do something bad? How bad does it have to be? I mean if-- do you have to-- if you feel like it's bad enough to damn you, are you damned? I mean, if you don't feel any remorse?CalebIs that it? You betrayed somebody and then didn't feel any remorse? Is that what all those pregnant pauses during the poker banter were about?PeterWell--CalebHow can you say you don't have any remorse when you're practically tearing your hair out worrying about going to hell?PeterBut being afraid of punishment isn't the same as remorse. Remorse is truly feeling apologetic for what you've done, not just worrying about being punished for it.CalebAnd you don't feel sorry at all?PeterNo.CalebEven though you recognize that what you did was wrong?PeterThat's right.CalebYou know, Pete, you're a very complex guy.PeterThank you.WomanThey went to sea in a sieve, they did. In a sieve, they went to sea. In spite of all their friends could say, on a winter's morn, on a stormy day, in a seive they went to sea.CalebDondi, what's with the old lady?DondiThe cigar smoke is causing her to recite \"The Jumblies\" by Edward Lear.CalebWell, shut her up, will you? I can hardly hear myself think.DondiShut up, grandmother.PeterI mean, what am I doing here? Who are these strange people? I don't remember deciding to come to Italy. What am I doing in Italy?CalebMaybe to see the Pope?PeterJust last week, I was in France, in Rouen, the town where Joan of Arc was burned at the stake. And I was visiting the tower where she was held before her execution. And I was thinking about writing a letter, you know, apologizing. A letter apologizing to the injured party.I was looking down from the highest window in the tower. And just how you do-- you know, you try to tap into the place in yourself where you have truly apologetic feelings, because you want to be sincere. You don't want the letter to sound phony.Except I realized, I discovered that there was no such place in myself, that where that place should have been, there was just an empty hole. And it was frightening. It was like staring into the abyss.CalebGo see the Pope. Ask for absolution.PeterBut you have to be repentant. I'm not repentant.CalebYou could just act repentant. That's what ritual is all about, going through the motions.PeterNo. I'd have to be truly sorry in my heart, or it wouldn't save me.CalebThat is a very rigid attitude.PeterWhat do you mean?

Jeff also played Caleb. Peter Handler played Peter. Lisa Stodder played Dondi and played the dying grandmother.Act Two: Act TwoIra GlassHow bad is bad? How bad is bad enough to count to send you to hell? Well, Michael Warr is a local poet and director of the Guild Complex here in Chicago. And he joins us in this, our radio playhouse.Ira GlassAnd Michael, you were raised with certain, very particular ideas about when a sin was bad enough to actually count.Michael WarrYeah. I was raised as a Jehovah's Witness. It was like my whole life was enveloped by what is a sin. And as a Jehovah's Witness, it was Armageddon or paradise.And at a very young age, I decided I did not want to live in paradise because there were these pictures of paradise. The pictures would always be idyllic. And there would be the lion lying with the lamb, everyone sitting around peacefully. And the fascinating thing about the Jehovah's Witnesses, and this is something that affects me to this very day, is that it was a very multicultural type of religion.And so I would look at these pictures. And I noticed that when there were black people in the pictures, that the sisters, their heads were always covered. And that was because there was a political issue that had not really been resolved. And that is in paradise, what would their hair be like?See, this is when the natural was a political statement. So that they didn't show them wearing naturals. And believe it or not, this was like a political awakening for me because in high school, these were serious issues. The natural was just like the Black Power sign. It was a political statement. So I said to myself, well, if the sisters can't wear afros in paradise, I don't want to be there.Ira GlassNow, you've brought some of your poems about your experience with these rules. And they're here. Actually, you're a very modern poet, and you've brought your color Macintosh, portable Macintosh, here. Why don't we flip it on?Michael WarrOK. Let's see if--[STARTUP NOISE]Michael WarrI don't know if you can actually call it a flip, but it's on.Ira GlassIt's on.Michael WarrYeah, I have a poem that I have written called \"Rules That Don't Work.\"Smokey Robinson was a mulatto devil with [? Afro-Motownian ?] rhythm locked inside a black plastic analog disk. Every time he curled his snaking tongue to sing, Satan channeled Motown messages to the epicenter of some sinner's soul, making it shake like the quake in Zechariah, hard as Babylonian tablets and wet as the Red Sea. [SINGING] Baby, baby.Slow dancing was wicked. To avoid temptation, we were to dance 18 inches apart, a safe 18 inches.On the Oakland side of the bay, black 'hovahs broke all the rules. Having to rebel against something, as other black denominations were breaking windows, tossing Molotovs, and tearing down pillars of the state, they danced, never really measuring the distance between their sacrilegious mounds. Touching more than my ear, that first skintight slow song with sister Sheila Berry was so, so, so evil that a bolt of lightning could have crashed through the roof of that dingy, oil-scented, black-lit ghetto garage and struck me down with the evidence of sin still in my ignorant arms. Dying smiling but confused, not comprehending how her pelvis could be so simultaneously rigid and relaxed, rigid then relaxed, like that thing my father told me not to do. Was it the devil that made her move like that? Sunday morning, I asked my mother and don't remember her giving me an answer.Ira GlassDo you think that it's only possible to be heavily engaged in these issues, or it's much easier to be heavily engaged in these issues, when you are young? That is, I was talking to this guy about this. And he told me this story about how when he was a kid, not even a teenager yet, he stole a cheap little tin toy car of a kind his parents never would have bought him that he shoplifted out of a dime store.And he said he felt such a profound guilt about the wrongness of this that he could never play with it in good conscience. He could never play with it. And eventually, he just threw it away. He just threw it in the garbage because he thought it was so wrong. And I wondered if you think that our sense of right and wrong is much bigger, our awareness of it, the internal debate about what is right and wrong, is much more acute when we're kids.Michael WarrI think that it's far more complicated because you have not formulated your own ideas about what is right, what is wrong. It's totally coming from outside of you. And I think that the environment I was coming up in, in which there was this metaphysical world that I was being force-fed every single day--Ira GlassThe Witnesses [INAUDIBLE].Michael Warr--of my life. Yeah. I mean, I had home Bible study Monday night, public Bible study Tuesday night, home Bible study Wednesday night, training in a theocratic school Thursday night, study ofTheWatchtowerandAwake!at home Friday night,WatchtowerandAwake!door-to-door distribution Saturday morning, Sunday morning, and then public lecture Sunday afternoon. That is what you call indoctrination, right?But on the other hand, there was this other thing going on where I'm reading James Baldwin and reading Malcolm X and literally leading rebellions in high school. In other words, I really didn't have a lot of time beating myself and saying \"This is wrong. This is wrong,\" in terms of buying a Black Panther newspaper or supporting the Black Panthers in those days or something. That might have been considered-- that was a sin for a Jehovah's Witness.But I was convinced by the conditions at the time that hey, if it's a sin, it's the right thing to do. I doubt if I could have explained it that way at the time. But I know I didn't feel guilty about it.Ira GlassMichael Warr, thank you for coming into our radio playhouse and reading for us.Michael WarrThank you. It's the most I've talked about the Jehovah's Witnesses in years.Ira GlassMichael Warr is the author ofWeAretheBlackBoy.More thoughts about sin, sinning, what's wrong, what's not wrong, when our radio playhouse, my radio playhouse,YourRadioPlayhousecontinues.Act Three: Act ThreeIra GlassThis isYourRadioPlayhouse.Small Scale Sin on today's program. I'm Ira Glass.So Eli was a big-time computer hacker. He and his friends were thrown into prison for this. He served six months. And here's what he says about his time in the big house.EliIt was so fun. I have to say, I had fun. It was a good experience. And I don't regret going there, actually.Ira GlassI think a lot of people are going to hear this and feel a certain horror. They're going to feel like, well, people should be punished.EliOh yeah. What I did was a bad thing, and I don't suggest anybody else do it, because that would be wrong. I don't do anything illegal anymore.Ira GlassThis is a story of someone who does not fear hell or punishment. It's a story of somebody who's been put into the position of defining for himself what is right and what is wrong. Starting in the mid-1980s, Eli was a member of a crew of computer hackers called MOD. At the time, journalists from theVillageVoiceandEsquiremagazine documented just how much they were able to do.It is entirely possible that no group of American computer hackers has before or since gotten so far in breaking into other people's computers. They infiltrated dozens of business and government networks. The reporters fromEsquire, at one point, asked them to demonstrate their skills by breaking into the White House computer system. And then they watched them do it.But for MOD, their real love was the biggest, most complicated computer system in the world, the phone system. They were in at the highest level computers that run the phone system for New York and New England. And this way, they could assign any services to any phone, listen to any phone, disconnect or create accounts, get unlisted phone numbers, or bring the entire phone system down.Eli served six months in a minimum-security prison and six months on home confinement. I spoke with him this summer, while he was still on home confinement in his parents' house in Queens.EliThe prison I had gone to was very relaxed. We played tennis, basketball. We had tournaments and got trophies. It was at Allenwood FPC. And playing Monopoly with the other inmates and Scrabble and stuff, it was just a wild concept.And then when I came back here, it actually bummed me out that I had to be home all day. It was like, where does this make sense? They're doing me a favor by letting me out, yet I had more fun in there. Something's not right. Something was very not right.It was more like a fame camp. People who were known and people who were involved in high-profile cases went there. That's what it was.I had a couple of really good friends there. My best friend there was a fellow by the name of Chris who lived out in San Diego and was involved in marijuana dealing. And he used to sell it through the mail. And he got caught. And they took away about $350,000 from him. And he's my age, probably 23, 24, something like that.And it was sad that he got five years. He was a nice guy. He was just like me. And we would hang out all the time.And across from me on the other side of my room was a man they used to call the Condo King. And he lived in Massachusetts in a castle that was probably worth $5 million and had butlers and Rolls Royces and this and that. And it was a real castle and right on the water.And he taught me about real estate, which was the funny thing. So I learned real estate from him. I learned about stocks. I learned from the best. And it was such a great experience. It was like college all over again.The attitude there was that of camaraderie. Everybody there had this one thing in common, and that was that they looked for the shortest way possible to achieve what they wanted to achieve. And they all got there at some point. And they just felt a stroke of bad luck, I suppose.There were no losers there, that's for sure. Everybody there had achieved a very high level of success, were very well known in whatever they did. And I was friends with all the mobsters there. And they took care of me and stuff because I was from New York and I knew about Little Italy and Mulberry and the Village and stuff.And when I went there, it was like, hey, another guy from New York. Kid's from the streets. And they were just impressed because I was the only hacker in this whole compound. So everybody knew me. As soon as I got there, a day later, everybody was blabbing, hey, there's this hacker in here. Even the guards were telling the inmates, hey, that guy's in here for this.Ira GlassOutside, in the hacking community, Eli was pretty well known. Actually, he was known by his handle, which was Acid Phreak. That's \"Phreak\" with a P-H at the beginning of it. Inside, in prison, he got all sorts of job offers. It turns out that lots of people in prison can use the services of a computer hacker.EliEverything from obtaining credit cards to changing credit to-- yeah, changing credit was a big thing. Because, I don't know if you know about this, but every time these real estate guys get busted, their credit usually goes down the tubes. One big request I had was to change a lot of credit reports and stuff. And I didn't do that and didn't take it seriously. I just told them, yeah, it was possible, but you're not going to get it from me.And there was a lot of mobsters who wanted me to set up phone lines for them that couldn't be detected by the police and things like that. And again, \"Well, it's possible. But I can't do that for you.\" But then again, if you were to ask me that and I was to do it, I wouldn't tell you anyway. So that's kind of a question that's hard to answer.Come into my domain. This is my room. As you can see, it's a typical teenager room.Ira GlassWell, actually, it was only sort of typical. The bedroom that he lives in during his six-month home confinement is tiny, barely enough space for a bed, a desk, and a bookshelf. There's a TV and a VCR, two computers. He flips on the stereo.EliI don't know. I guess I've got kind of a lot of equipment around here. I've got a fax machine here. In my room, I've got five phone lines. I got a two-line phone, but I've got everything else connected to computers or fax.Ira GlassThere were cheesy kung fu movies on video. On his CD player, there was old-school rap, Nine Inch Nails, the Doors, Jimi Hendrix. And then he says, \"Let me show you the good stuff,\" and he pulls out Xeroxes of old spiral notebooks.EliI have here what was seized from me but they had to return back to me. Here's my evidence examination report by the United States Secret Service. Subject, Acid Phreak. These notes have basically all the systems I got into. Look, I have little sketches and diagrams of how things work, different protocols and networks, definitions. See, a lot of this stuff was really good. I had stuff outside the country, NASA.Ira GlassThe something defense? What is that?EliGovernment defense.Ira GlassGovernment defense.EliYeah, that's a Washington number. McDonald's, since I had Telenet, I had McDonald's accounts. If you're a McDonald's employee, I could raise your pay. So that way, you get $15 an hour for shuffling burgers and stuff.Ira GlassSo did you decide just at random to help someone out?EliI didn't do it to anybody. I just wanted to know how.We did this from pay phones. We'd have a line of pay phones. We'd get into the computer, first liberate one phone. \"Liberating\" meaning make it so that you don't need quarters for that pay phone. You just pick up and dial like a regular house phone. So that way, we could make an endless amount of phone calls without putting quarters.Next step was to get into the network, find a session that was already going, and then knock them off while they were connected, and then sit there, watching them. In other words, put us in the place of the computer they were going to connect to. So the next time they'd try to log in, they would get our computer. And we'd type in, \"login.\" And they'd put in their login account.Then we'd go, \"password,\" you know? The password. They'd say, \"OK, password,\" and they'd put their password in. And then we would have-- all these things were already encoded in one key, so we could just hit one key. And it wouldn't look like we were typing it.Ira GlassLogin would just appear, whoomp. Input password, whoomp.EliLogin. And then we'd hit the password key, and password would come out. And then we'd say \"Login incorrect\" and then disconnect from them. But we already got their login and password.And then when they reconnected, it would be the regular system. So they'd figure, hey, I made a mistake typing it in or something. And that's how we would get in accounts. It was funny.You get into things that are good. You start targeting systems that are interesting. And then you start developing a collection. It's like baseball cards. I have NASA. I have NSA. I've got the phone company computers. I've got MISR. I've got Cosmos. I've got this. I've got that.McDonnell-Douglas, Marriott Marietta. TRW, CBI, TransUnion. What else can I get? You try to get the big names. So you start developing your collection.Then after a while, it became fun to look up famous people. Let's look up John Gotti's credit. Let's see what he owns. Let's look up Julia Roberts. Let's get her home phone number. Let's get this guy's home phone number.We'd go into pay phones and stuff. And hooking up, I would drive up to a pay phone real quick and do what I had to do and leave really quick. That's where I really got into a movie. I felt like it was likeMission:Impossible,like that whole gang. It was like-- [HUMMING \"MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE THEME\"].And we would all go out and hook up and everything. And it was like, \"Yeah, all right. I'm that black guy who does all this technical stuff. I can get into it. Let's go, let's go.\"I felt like we should have walkie-talkies and headsets and everything, and be like, \"OK, Blue. Go do your thing on five. Ready? Five, four three, you're in. You're in.\" It was just amazing after a while. And we were just so excited we were getting all that stuff. And it was just a rush. It was the flow.Once you start going, you can't stop. You're just steamrolling one after the other. And the flow gets you going, and then you're just like, \"Yeah, we rule. We're it.\" It breaks down all barriers. Nothing can stop the flow. If you've got the flow, you can conquer everything. That's what people call being in the zone. Once you're in there, you can't stop. It's the juice.Ira GlassIf anything, it's surprising how little they did with their power over computers. It was mostly pranks, making somebody's phone ring continuously, turning an enemy's home phone line into a pay phone line so when the guy picked up his phone at home, it demanded that he deposit a quarter. Of course, there was no way he could do that because it's his home phone.They did actually call Julia Roberts once. They called Queen Elizabeth, too. But there's an emptiness at the heart of a lot of these stories. Once you've got the Queen on the phone, what do you say?EliShe's like, \"Hello?\" She's talking to us and stuff. And we don't know what to say. \"Hi, we're calling from the United States, and this and that.\" And she knew what was up. She's like, \"OK, hello.\" And then she said goodbye, and that was it.We didn't know what to say. What do you say to Queen Elizabeth? \"Hi. So you see that movie,TrueLies?\"You know, what do you say? The fun of it is finding the number.Ira GlassEli was thrown into prison for a relatively minor offense. Some of the members of his crew broke into the computers that list everybody's credit ratings. And they copied some credit reports. And they sold the information to other people. And he was named as a member of this conspiracy.EliThey said we abused our power. But we didn't abuse it at all. We did nothing compared to the things that could have been done. What we did was such a small thing in such a larger scheme of things.It's kind of depressing, in a way. There's so many things we could have done. We could have monitored Peter Lynch. What's the next best investment for the day? And we'd make millions of dollars investing or shorting some stock. But we never did. And now we wonder why. We're like, \"Damn. There are so many applications for this kind of stuff. What happened?\" But then we're like, \"Ah, we were just kids.\"Then one time, one of us got theMadmagazine owner's phone number. And we called him. And that time, he was going through some rough times or something. And we were calling him for about two weeks. And he was just so goofy. He was kind of crazy. And he was just really stressed or something. And we just kept calling him and calling him.And finally, we started harassing him and harassing him. We'd make fun of him and laugh at him and call him Alfred E. Neuman. And just ridicule him. And then he got so mad at us. And we used to keep calling and screwing around with him.And then one day, we read in a paper he died. The day after we had called him, he passes away. And we're there like, \"Yo, did we kill him? I hope not.\" And then they said he had some nervous breakdown and this and that. We're like, \"Oh my god. Oh my god. I think we contributed to his demise there. We better not tell anybody this.\" But then we realized that there was probably other factors that contributed to it, not just a kid calling him on the phone. But since then, we stopped doing things like that because it was like, \"Oh my god.\"I don't destroy computers. I don't take them down. I don't delete information that shouldn't be deleted. I think there's something morally wrong if you affect a person personally in not only his computer life, but his personal life, his right to make a living. I think that's wrong. It's just a question of morality.Ira GlassOne thing about the computer world is that it's all so new. And hacking on computers is so new that each person who does it feels like he or she can create his or her own moral code. And Eli's crew had its own particular code of behavior. For example, unlike most hackers, they didn't share what they knew with other hackers.EliWe had complete control over certain networks. We could have any system we wanted on that network. Any host was ours. But you don't let it get out to other hacking groups and other hackers. Because if they don't know how to use it, they don't understand the power of it all, you can't trust them. It's too much power for some people.Basically, it's like having a gun. Let's say it's the Wild West. You take it upon yourself to have a gun, you're responsible for it. If you give that to someone, you're responsible for that. So you don't give it out. If you want to shoot somebody's sister, somebody's wife or something, that's upon you. It's all a question of morality in my eyes.And if I know something, and it's of importance to somebody else, who's to tell me I can't sell it if I know it? Like if I knew something about you that somebody would pay a price for, it's up to me and my own morality whether I would sell it to him or not. But nobody could tell me, \"You can't do that.\"Like if I know about your credit history, and somebody comes up to me and says, \"I'm doing background on him. I want to know. Can you get me his credit history?\" If I think it's immoral, I'm not going to do it. But if for some reason I think that he's going to get it anyway, and it would benefit me, I'd probably give it to him anyway.We're not evil people. We're good people at heart. There was a time when me and my friend, Nynex Phreak, another guy in the group, we found a system that actually, what it did was you could input a certain series of digits. It would take those digits and see if it was a credit card. So you could basically hack out credit card numbers just by guessing. Is this a credit card? And it would tell you if it was or not. And we found that system.Finally, somebody wrote a program that would automatically do it, scan all night and get thousands of credit cards. And we're like, yeah, this is no good. What if they start selling credit cards and stuff? We're like, this is no good. So we actually called the FBI and told them about it.We wouldn't narc on anybody. We wouldn't say who wrote it or anything. We just said, there's a system, and it isn't right it's open like that. It was just getting ridiculous.So I was like, \"We've got to put an end to this.\" And we did that. And we were like, \"Damn. We can't tell any hacker we did this. They'll be pissed.\" And we felt like that was right to do. That's kind of wrong.Ira GlassIt is because of their own moral code in their group, and also their belief that someday hacking will no longer be seen as a crime, that society will change its ideas about information and computers and breaking into computers, that Eli is able to say something like this next quote about his time in the big house.EliI was a criminal in the sense that Jesus Christ was a criminal, you know? Well, you know how he was thought to be a criminal. And he was sentenced and everything. And now look. Everybody's sporting crosses. And there's churches built around him and everything. Who knows? Maybe one day, it'll be Acid Phreak, the faith. You never know.Ira GlassIn fact, when I was visiting Eli, he was facing a daily question of right and wrong when it came to his own home confinement. The prison system was keeping track of him during home confinement with this electronic device. It was about the size of a beeper. It was riveted onto an ankle strap.And it would send this signal to a computer that authorities had put into his house. And that computer would call another computer any time that he would leave the house. And as he explained, hacking these computers and the phone line that connected them was pretty easy work.But he did not do it. He said he just didn't want to get in any more trouble. He said he was going straight. And it wasn't because he thought hacking was wrong. It was that he was just tired of it.EliWe had lists and lists of computers and no time to do it in. It just got to the point where it was such a large burden. It was like, \"Aw, man. We got to do this one. Aw, there's another one we got to do.\" And then it got to hundreds and hundreds. And finally, it's not even fun anymore.It was such a rush to get it when you initially get it. But then, I don't know. It gets to be boring. I've just burned myself out, I think. I just got to that point where everybody gets burnt out if they have a little too much of everything.Ira GlassNow, though he was burned out, it was still a shock when the federal authorities seized all of his computers and he wasn't allowed to hack anymore. This was back when he was first arrested.EliIt was like, OK, what do I do? I usually get on the computer now, late at night and stuff. And you'd just go to sleep. And then my lifestyle started changing. I'd be sleeping at night again. So I was like, \"Damn. This is like-- I have to fill this void. What should I do?\" And I didn't know what to do anymore. It was horrible.It was sad. We would call each other up. And usually, we'd be talking about computers and trading passwords, and then we'd get into this and that. And I remember, the first time we called, it was like, \"So, what's up?\" \"Nothing. I cleaned my room yesterday.\" \"Yeah, they came over and cleaned my room, too, pretty well.\" \"Yeah, I know.\" \"So what do you want to do?\" \"I don't know.\"Because it's such a large part of our lives at that point. You have so much power and to lose it in an instant like that is just such a shock. It's like, bam. You don't have that power anymore. You can't sit on your computer. What are you going to do? Uh-oh, I'm a regular guy now. I'm not Acid Phreak anymore. What's Acid Phreak without a computer? He's just a regular guy. So it was a bummer.At this point, I've already done it. I see it as a teenager thing. OK, I was a hacker when I was a kid and this and that. I got busted. It's a teenager thing to do. And that's that. I move on. I work with computers now, and that's my life.Ira GlassWell, Acid Phreak was not the first criminal who told me that he quit being bad because he got bored with it. A few Chicago gang members have told me the same thing, that you end up having the same night over and over again. You just get tired of it.Maybe you remember the bookAClockworkOrange,the book and the movie. They're about teenage boys who love ultra-violence, commit murder, do all sorts of horrible things, speak to each other in a very stylized language.At the end of that book-- the movie actually doesn't end this way, but the original British edition of the novel does. At the end of the book, the central character gives up committing acts of violence. And it's not because he thinks it's wrong. And it's not because any of the punishments and treatments that he's received have worked on him.He gives it up because he's bored with it. It's just not that interesting to him. And we will end our program today with a couple of paragraphs from the book.\"I knew what was happening, O my brothers. I was like growing up. Yes yes yes, there it is. Youth must go. Ah, yes. But youth is only being in a way like it might be an animal. No, it is not just like being an animal so much as being like one of those malenky toys you viddy being sold in the streets, like little chellovecks made out of tin, with a spring inside and then a winding handle on the outside. And you wind it up, grrr grrr grrr and off it itties, like walking, O my brothers. But it itties in a straight line. And it bangs straight into things, bang bang. And it cannot help what it is doing. Being young is like being one of those malenky machines.\"And then at this point, the narrator starts going into this fantasy about having a son someday. And he says, \"When I had my son, I would like to explain all that to him, when he was starry enough to like understand. But then I knew he would not understand, or would not want to understand at all, and would do all the veshches I had done, yes perhaps even killing some poor starry forella surrounded with mewing kots and koshkas. And I would not be able to really stop him. And nor would he be able to stop his own son, brothers. And so it would itty on like that to the end of the world, round and round and round, like some bolshy, gigantic like chelloveck, like old Bog Himself, turning and turning and turning, a vonny grahzny orange in his gigantic rookers.\"CreditsIra GlassWell, this episode ofYourRadioPlayhousewas produced by WBEZ Chicago with generous funding from the MacArthur Foundation.

I'm Ira Glass.[FUNDING CREDITS]AnnouncerThis is WBEZ Chicago.,PrologueIra GlassOK, three boys, aged 13, 15, and 16. All three chose to appear with fake names on this radio program. And the fake names they chose, you ready? K-Rad, Mr. Warez, and Fred. Those first two names come from the world of computer hacking and software piracy. Mr. Warez, for example, that's \"warez,\" as in \"wares,\" as in \"softwares,\" as in pirated softwares, illegal softwares. And as for Fred--FredWhy Fred? For no reason, man. There's got to be someone else named Fred out there.Ira GlassYou see, anonymity was important given the kinds of things that we were discussing, namely credit card fraud, computer hacking, and the nature of hell. Well, from WBEZ in Chicago, this isYourRadioPlayhouse.I'm Ira Glass. Today on our playhouse stage, small-scale stories of small-scale sin. Stay with us, won't you?So K-Rad, Mr. Warez, and Fred were trying to be criminals. But they were not too successful at this. And at a McDonald's on Times Square in New York City, they told all. Doesn't that have a nice,HardCopysound to it? \"They told all.\"This was kind of an unpleasant McDonald's. Because it was in Times Square, they decided to have neon lights everywhere in this place. A crush of sweaty people at the counter, tourists, most of us. It was the middle of summer. Fred took charge.FredWhat do you guys want?K-radI want a number one meal.FredOK, I'm paying for this. You're paying for my cab, OK? Whatever I can pay for. OK, we'll have a number one meal.Ira GlassThey're actually in Manhattan for a computer hackers' convention this summer, and Fred was not used to the downtown prices.FredOh my god. It's $5, man. You guys are chipping in. I can't pay for this.Ira GlassI think it's fair to say that one sign that your criminal career is not going so well is if you have to worry about the prices at McDonald's. But K-Rad, Mr. Warez, and Fred were involved in very low-level types of crimes. All of them involve computers. They pirated software. They scammed free CD-ROM games. They cheated one of the big online computer services out of a few hundred dollars in online time.All in all, they didn't steal very much. And they didn't steal very effectively. But they did try to steal. Take this phone scam, where they would call people at random and try to get a calling card number or a credit card number out of them.K-radBasically, the way it works is this. You call up somebody. You say, \"This is the AT&T operator. I have a priority collect call for--\" so-and-so's name. And the whole point is you have to sound like you're not calling somebody up with the intention of getting them. You have to sound like you've been sitting in this chair for 10 hours, and you want to go home.So you got to go, \"This is the AT&T operator. I have a collect call for Paul. Will you accept charges, sir?\" \"Uh, yeah. I'll accept charges.\" \"All right, hold on one second.\"Then you tap on the keyboard. You say, \"I'm sorry. You seem to have a restriction on your phone line. You can't accept collect calls to this line.\" And then they yell, and they go, \"What do you mean, I can't accept collect calls to my line? I've been getting collect calls to this line for 20 years.\"And then, you've got to go, \"Sir, there's nothing I can do about it. My computer says you can't receive a collect call on this line. Would you like to try an alternate billing method?\" In which case they will proceed to either give you a calling card or a major credit card.Ira GlassAnd that, of course, is the idea behind the whole thing, to end up with a calling card number or a credit card number that is not your own, that you can use yourself. Now I should say that before you go out and try this yourselves, if you are thinking about doing this yourself right now, I should tell you one important fact. It doesn't work.K-radThe reason it doesn't work is because a good percentage of people, after the point at which they go through the mind-boggling experience of not understanding what it means to have a restriction on your line, because nobody knows what that means, then they'll just say, \"Oh, this is too much trouble. Forget it. I won't accept the collect call.\"Ira GlassThe other scams these guys run don't do much better. They tried to hack their way into the mainframe system of a big computer retailer. But they were caught and stopped before they got very far. They are such unaccomplished computer hackers that Fred himself was actually the victim of computer hackers twice. Someone broke into Fred's account on one computer bulletin board and used his account and his electronic mail to visit some of the nether regions of the net.FredRemember, you talked to the guy on IRC. There's this weird guy. This guy was going on all these sex channels. And he was wrecking my name and stuff. It was awful.K-radYou can't get pissed at him. I wouldn't get pissed at him, because that would be entirely hypocritical. I've said that if anybody ever steals one of my credit cards or ever hacks into my account or computer system, I will not care. And I will be perfectly allowable to that.To go and say, \"I can't believe it. Somebody took my credit card.\" Well, so what if I did it to everyone else? I'm perfectly willing to let someone do that to me.Ira GlassOver the summer was when they really started to get serious about using other people's credit cards, which they call \"carding.\" They met a guy who was good at this and who taught them some tricks. K-Rad and Fred ordered $1,600 in computer merchandise on someone else's credit card. They had it delivered to a neutral address. They picked it up. They sold half of it for cash.And one thing that's peculiar about this story is that these are rich kids. K-Rad and Fred live in a wealthy upstate community. They attend what is one of the most expensive, prestigious private schools in the country. But they steal.Fred believes that he has no choice. He really suffers over money. He's this skinny, young-looking 15-year-old. And he is perpetually strapped for cash. And he said that his parents couldn't help him much with money right now because they had just gone $500,000 into debt.FredBecause they bought a house right before the depression and stuff. The recession, excuse me. I consider it a depression. I've noticed the effects.Ira GlassAt one point, to get some cash, he actually sold the computer that his parents had bought for him. And I don't think they knew. His idea is that he wanted to replace the computer as quickly as he could with the help of a stranger's credit card.And he also wanted to get all the other things that the other kids at his expensive private school had. He wanted to have a microwave. He wanted to have a stereo. Basically, he just wanted to be like everybody else.FredI'm also pretty good at shoplifting. But my whole thing on that is that I will not steal anything if I have the money for it. And a lot of times, like the store at my school, like the grill, I steal from that a lot. But I also give them $10 for no reason if I have the money because I feel bad about what I've stolen. And if I ever get the money so I don't have to do this shit anymore, then I'm not going to do it.Ira GlassWhat's striking about this is how these boys want to convince themselves-- I think they really do-- want to convince themselves that they are good, and that what they do does not harm anyone. And if it does harm someone, there's always the reassuring thought that they keep very near at hand that someday they can make it up to the injured party.K-radAs noble as this sounds, this is one thing that I absolutely guarantee that sounds like the biggest load of crap anyone could ever say. But if I am ever in a financial--Mr. WarezWe believe in you.K-radNo, no one should believe in me. This is the biggest \"I'm really good inside.\" If I ever find myself-- and I've made this vow to myself-- in a good enough financial situation, I will repay everything I have ever done now. If I find myself making $2 million a year, I will send a $10,000 check to the company which I stole calling cards from. That is something I definitely want to do if I am in the financial situation to do it.Ira GlassK-Rad told me that the $1,600 that they charged to a stranger's Visa card was, in fact, a victimless crime, that the card owner would call Visa, have the charge removed from his bill. And that Visa figures a certain amount of fraud is just the cost of doing business.K-radOne thing that I've always said in all my doings is that I will never, ever do something that will severely hurt an individual person. OK? So for example, if it involves-- I would never mug someone. I would never beat someone up for money. I'd never shoplift. Well, maybe I-- no, I wouldn't shoplift.Ira GlassThat's one of my favorite parts of the interview. Hold on. I'm just going to play that tape back. Because you can actually hear him-- he's struggling so much, you can actually hear him working it out out loud. Hold on, I'm just going to rewind for a second.[TAPE REWINDING]K-rad--never beat someone up for money. I'd never shoplift. Well, maybe I-- no, I wouldn't shoplift. Because that is hurting the individual person.Ira GlassSee what I mean? So we headed out of the McDonald's and back to the hotel where the computer hackers' convention was taking place. On the way, without any prompting at all, Fred elaborated on the idea that he was only stealing because he absolutely had to.FredI go to boarding school. And I don't have that much-- I don't have any money or anything. And I get really hungry and stuff. I have a fast metabolism. And seriously, I starve. And I lost 10 pounds in one week. And that's not good for someone who's really skinny, like I am. And then a lot of it is just stuff I want, you know?And yeah, I just really want to stress that in other ways, we're not bad people. And we don't go around trying to screw all people in any way we can. Because we're not at all.I mean, I do social work. I tutored kids. I do a lot of stuff which isn't necessarily evil and more good. But sometimes, it's just like, I don't know, man. I like doing it. I can't explain it.Ira GlassTalk about that part of it. What is the thrill of doing it?FredThat's the first-- that was the reason I started carding. The reason was the thrill of going. When we went in there, it was likeMission:Impossible.We went in. We had gloves on and stuff. And we picked it up. We had it all worked out. We were connected. We had lookouts and stuff. And it's just a lot of fun. It's like you're doing stuff that is not exactly legal, not legal at all. And it's fun.Ira GlassBy this point, we were back in the hotel lobby. We took the elevators up to the floor where the hackers' convention was taking place. K-Rad said that real hackers do not use their skills like this. They do not use their skills for personal gain. They don't do carding. They don't steal.The whole idea of computer hacking, for these guys anyway, is that it's a kind of pure, zen pursuit. It's an ends in itself. You break into the computer for its own sake and to look around, and for the knowledge of everyone, especially you.We stood in the hallway. People streamed by. We tried to move to a corner where we would not be overheard. And K-Rad said, actually, that they had never really talked about their illegal activities this much before with anyone.K-radThe most thing I'm worried about is I'm actually starting, for the first time, to say this all out loud, everything I've done. And suddenly, it doesn't sound as hacker, much, anymore. And I've known that ever since I moved into doing maybe some credit card thing. And that's why I'm, in fact, even considering giving up on doing all the carding and stuff like that, which seriously, I am.Ira GlassFred then shot him this look. Because if K-Rad were serious, and they did stop carding, Fred would not be able to get a computer to replace the old one that his parents gave him.FredWhat about my computer?K-radWhat?Mr. WarezYour computer will come first.FredJesus Christ, man. I want to get a gun and shoot you.K-radAll right, after your computer.Ira GlassThe thing about a bad conscience is that it splits you in half. And Fred said that he had two different modes. That was the word he used, \"modes.\" He said that sometimes he would think about what they were doing. And he knew it was wrong, and it would bother him. But mostly, he tried not to think about it.FredMy worst fear is that I can end up going to hell for doing this. And that's my worst fear.Ira GlassDo you believe in hell?FredYeah, I do.Ira GlassAnd you think you can go to hell for getting a computer on somebody else's credit card?FredI don't know. I hope not. I really hope not. It's always been my biggest fear. That's why I'm afraid of dying. I'm afraid if there's something I've done which just is like the straw on the camel's back, that's going to be what's going to do it.Ira GlassHow big is this worry? Will this keep you up at night?FredYeah, maybe for a couple minutes. And then I just sort of put it out of my mind, you know?Ira GlassHis share of the carding profits was $800. I told him that from an adult's perspective, this did not seem like a lot of money. I didn't think you could do eternity in hell for $800.And as soon as I said this, I really regretted it. Fred's body language changed completely. It was like I was calling him a little kid. It was like saying that he was ridiculous to worry over something so small. It was just one of these moments. He got quieter, and he kind of pulled into himself a little bit.Then Mr. Warez spoke up. He said that sure, maybe by adult standards, this wasn't much money. But to them, it was a lot, that it was plenty enough to count.When is hell a possibility? Whenever you think it is, it is. More on this when our program continues.Act One: Act OneIra GlassWell, this isYourRadioPlayhouse. Now a little radio experiment. We told a Chicago playwright named Jeff Dorchen what K-Rad, Fred, and Mr. Warez said about hell and about sin and about their own relative badness in this world. And we asked Jeff Dorchen to write an original radio play that would pick up the themes where the boys leave off. So here's what he came up with.CalebI'll call.DondiMe too.CalebThree 10's.PeterFull house, aces and eights.CalebOoh. What do you got, kid?DondiFour diamonds.CalebYou got nothing.PeterSee, if you had some where the numbers matched, or if they were in order, and there were five of them. But that, what you have there, that's nothing.CalebMy grandpa used to call that a kangaroo straight.PeterMy dad used to call it a Klondike.DondiKlondike wins the game.CalebNo, Klondike doesn't win the game. Peter wins the game. Full house wins.DondiI hate you, Peter.PeterI don't blame you.[WAILING]DondiGrandmother, be careful. Grazie.PeterMy deal. Straight, five card draw.CalebAnything wild?PeterNo.Dondi[UNINTELLIGIBLE]CalebShut up. Ow. Watch it with those cards, man.PeterSorry.CalebWhat's your problem today?DondiHe has sinned.PeterYeah-- yes, I have. How did you know?DondiYour eyes. They are the eyes of an accused man, furtive, alert, the eyes of a nervous beast who, once a lover of gambols and jigs and standard metals, has been driven to nocturnal skulking by the pursuit of a relentless predator.CalebHe's got you there. 10,000 lira.DondiCall.PeterCall. Caleb, do you believe in sin?CalebHell, no. I believe in damnation, though.PeterHow can you believe in damnation but not sin?CalebPredestiny. Take me. I was born damned. I'm cowardly, petty, intolerant, lazy, and just generally destructive. I knew I was damned the first time I heard the word.DondiYour Calvinism relieves you of the responsibility for improving yourself.CalebShut up, kid.[SLAP]DondiOw!PeterWhat are you doing?DondiIt's all right, GI Joe. I am strong.CalebYeah, Pete. The kid can take it. Now give me three.PeterHow many, Dondi?DondiFour.PeterYou can't have four. The most you can have is three.DondiOK. I'll take two.PeterAnd two for the dealer.Caleb5,000.DondiCall.PeterCall. What do you have?CalebA pair of 9's. Dondi?DondiThree onions.CalebThose are spades, not onions. And you're supposed to match the numbers, not the suit, you little spaghetti sucker.DondiI have a Klondike.CalebYou have garbage. How many times do we have to go through this? It's like rolling a boulder up a hill just to have it roll back down again, over and over and over.DondiI will not make the mistake again, sahib.CalebDon't call me sahib. Peter, what do you have? A pair of jacks. All right. Pair of jacks takes it. All right. Seven card stud poker, one-eyed royalty, red deuces, nines, and all odd-numbered clubs are wild.PeterWhat do you guys think the worst sin is? Murder?DondiBetrayal.PeterWhy do you say that?DondiAt the center of the ninth and innermost frozen circle of hell, Lucifer devours Judas eternally.PeterReally?DondiThat's what they say. One million lira.PeterI'll see that and raise you one.CalebCall.DondiI'm there.CalebWhat do you got?DondiSeven aces.PeterMe too.CalebSo do I. All right, so there were a few too many wild cards. Let's hold the pot over.DondiOK. Peter?PeterHuh? Oh, sure. Leave it over. Do you think a sin is worse if say you, for example, you betray somebody? Then suppose you don't feel any remorse. Does that make it worse?DondiOf course. Gentlemen, the game is Chicago low. Ace, no face, sevens, follow the queen.PeterWait a second, Dondi. Caleb, could I talk to you alone for a second, over there, by the window?CalebSure, Pete.DondiI will go fetch us some delicious ginger ale.CalebGood idea. What is it, Pete? Think the kid's trying to hustle us?PeterNo, I just wanted to talk, that's all.CalebWhat's the matter?PeterNothing. Just I'm afraid of going to hell.CalebWhat? Why?PeterI just don't think I'm a very good person.CalebThat's ridiculous, Pete. You're a very nice guy. You write letters. I never write letters.PeterYeah, but what if you do something bad? How bad does it have to be? I mean if-- do you have to-- if you feel like it's bad enough to damn you, are you damned? I mean, if you don't feel any remorse?CalebIs that it? You betrayed somebody and then didn't feel any remorse? Is that what all those pregnant pauses during the poker banter were about?PeterWell--CalebHow can you say you don't have any remorse when you're practically tearing your hair out worrying about going to hell?PeterBut being afraid of punishment isn't the same as remorse. Remorse is truly feeling apologetic for what you've done, not just worrying about being punished for it.CalebAnd you don't feel sorry at all?PeterNo.CalebEven though you recognize that what you did was wrong?PeterThat's right.CalebYou know, Pete, you're a very complex guy.PeterThank you.WomanThey went to sea in a sieve, they did. In a sieve, they went to sea. In spite of all their friends could say, on a winter's morn, on a stormy day, in a seive they went to sea.CalebDondi, what's with the old lady?DondiThe cigar smoke is causing her to recite \"The Jumblies\" by Edward Lear.CalebWell, shut her up, will you? I can hardly hear myself think.DondiShut up, grandmother.PeterI mean, what am I doing here? Who are these strange people? I don't remember deciding to come to Italy. What am I doing in Italy?CalebMaybe to see the Pope?PeterJust last week, I was in France, in Rouen, the town where Joan of Arc was burned at the stake. And I was visiting the tower where she was held before her execution. And I was thinking about writing a letter, you know, apologizing. A letter apologizing to the injured party.I was looking down from the highest window in the tower. And just how you do-- you know, you try to tap into the place in yourself where you have truly apologetic feelings, because you want to be sincere. You don't want the letter to sound phony.Except I realized, I discovered that there was no such place in myself, that where that place should have been, there was just an empty hole. And it was frightening. It was like staring into the abyss.CalebGo see the Pope. Ask for absolution.PeterBut you have to be repentant. I'm not repentant.CalebYou could just act repentant. That's what ritual is all about, going through the motions.PeterNo. I'd have to be truly sorry in my heart, or it wouldn't save me.CalebThat is a very rigid attitude.PeterWhat do you mean? I can't just pretend to have remorse.CalebYou haven't even tried. I mean, the Pope's a very nearsighted, distracted old man. If you buried your face in your hands and pretended to sob, I'm sure he'd buy it.PeterIt's not a question of fooling the Pope.CalebYou know, I'm starting to think that you don't really want to help yourself.PeterHow did I get here? Why are we playing poker in Italy with a demonic little boy whose grandmother is dying in the next room?[PEACOCK CRY]PeterWhat was that?[PEACOCK CRY]CalebA peacock.PeterHuh. What's that a symbol of?CalebPride. Look, there it is, in the middle of the cemetery.[PEACOCK CRY]PeterIt's golden, a golden peacock in the middle of a graveyard. I wonder what it means.CalebMy advice is that you come up with the most positive interpretation you can.DondiWe're out of ginger ale. I can only offer you root beer.PeterOh.CalebAww.PeterWell, that's all right.DondiAll right, gentlemen. The game is--CalebWe know what the game is, you little pistachio masher.DondiWho dealt this mess?CalebDon't give me that bluffing baloney. You got a possible straight flush in onions.DondiDo not mention onions, sahib. My grandfather was killed by Il Duce.CalebDon't call me sahib.PeterTalk is cheap, gentlemen. 2 million lira.[PEACOCK CRY]Ira GlassWell, \"The Golden Peacock\" was written forYourRadioPlayhouseby Jeff Dorchen. Jeff also played Caleb. Peter Handler played Peter. Lisa Stodder played Dondi and played the dying grandmother.Act Two: Act TwoIra GlassHow bad is bad? How bad is bad enough to count to send you to hell? Well, Michael Warr is a local poet and director of the Guild Complex here in Chicago. And he joins us in this, our radio playhouse.Ira GlassAnd Michael, you were raised with certain, very particular ideas about when a sin was bad enough to actually count.Michael WarrYeah. I was raised as a Jehovah's Witness. It was like my whole life was enveloped by what is a sin. And as a Jehovah's Witness, it was Armageddon or paradise.And at a very young age, I decided I did not want to live in paradise because there were these pictures of paradise. The pictures would always be idyllic. And there would be the lion lying with the lamb, everyone sitting around peacefully. And the fascinating thing about the Jehovah's Witnesses, and this is something that affects me to this very day, is that it was a very multicultural type of religion.And so I would look at these pictures. And I noticed that when there were black people in the pictures, that the sisters, their heads were always covered. And that was because there was a political issue that had not really been resolved. And that is in paradise, what would their hair be like?See, this is when the natural was a political statement. So that they didn't show them wearing naturals. And believe it or not, this was like a political awakening for me because in high school, these were serious issues. The natural was just like the Black Power sign. It was a political statement. So I said to myself, well, if the sisters can't wear afros in paradise, I don't want to be there.Ira GlassNow, you've brought some of your poems about your experience with these rules. And they're here. Actually, you're a very modern poet, and you've brought your color Macintosh, portable Macintosh, here. Why don't we flip it on?Michael WarrOK. Let's see if--[STARTUP NOISE]Michael WarrI don't know if you can actually call it a flip, but it's on.Ira GlassIt's on.Michael WarrYeah, I have a poem that I have written called \"Rules That Don't Work.\"Smokey Robinson was a mulatto devil with [? Afro-Motownian ?] rhythm locked inside a black plastic analog disk. Every time he curled his snaking tongue to sing, Satan channeled Motown messages to the epicenter of some sinner's soul, making it shake like the quake in Zechariah, hard as Babylonian tablets and wet as the Red Sea. [SINGING] Baby, baby.Slow dancing was wicked. To avoid temptation, we were to dance 18 inches apart, a safe 18 inches.On the Oakland side of the bay, black 'hovahs broke all the rules. Having to rebel against something, as other black denominations were breaking windows, tossing Molotovs, and tearing down pillars of the state, they danced, never really measuring the distance between their sacrilegious mounds. Touching more than my ear, that first skintight slow song with sister Sheila Berry was so, so, so evil that a bolt of lightning could have crashed through the roof of that dingy, oil-scented, black-lit ghetto garage and struck me down with the evidence of sin still in my ignorant arms. Dying smiling but confused, not comprehending how her pelvis could be so simultaneously rigid and relaxed, rigid then relaxed, like that thing my father told me not to do. Was it the devil that made her move like that? Sunday morning, I asked my mother and don't remember her giving me an answer.Ira GlassDo you think that it's only possible to be heavily engaged in these issues, or it's much easier to be heavily engaged in these issues, when you are young? That is, I was talking to this guy about this. And he told me this story about how when he was a kid, not even a teenager yet, he stole a cheap little tin toy car of a kind his parents never would have bought him that he shoplifted out of a dime store.And he said he felt such a profound guilt about the wrongness of this that he could never play with it in good conscience. He could never play with it. And eventually, he just threw it away. He just threw it in the garbage because he thought it was so wrong. And I wondered if you think that our sense of right and wrong is much bigger, our awareness of it, the internal debate about what is right and wrong, is much more acute when we're kids.Michael WarrI think that it's far more complicated because you have not formulated your own ideas about what is right, what is wrong. It's totally coming from outside of you. And I think that the environment I was coming up in, in which there was this metaphysical world that I was being force-fed every single day--Ira GlassThe Witnesses [INAUDIBLE].Michael Warr--of my life. Yeah. I mean, I had home Bible study Monday night, public Bible study Tuesday night, home Bible study Wednesday night, training in a theocratic school Thursday night, study ofTheWatchtowerandAwake!at home Friday night,WatchtowerandAwake!door-to-door distribution Saturday morning, Sunday morning, and then public lecture Sunday afternoon. That is what you call indoctrination, right?But on the other hand, there was this other thing going on where I'm reading James Baldwin and reading Malcolm X and literally leading rebellions in high school. In other words, I really didn't have a lot of time beating myself and saying \"This is wrong. This is wrong,\" in terms of buying a Black Panther newspaper or supporting the Black Panthers in those days or something. That might have been considered-- that was a sin for a Jehovah's Witness.But I was convinced by the conditions at the time that hey, if it's a sin, it's the right thing to do. I doubt if I could have explained it that way at the time. But I know I didn't feel guilty about it.Ira GlassMichael Warr, thank you for coming into our radio playhouse and reading for us.Michael WarrThank you. It's the most I've talked about the Jehovah's Witnesses in years.Ira GlassMichael Warr is the author ofWeAretheBlackBoy.More thoughts about sin, sinning, what's wrong, what's not wrong, when our radio playhouse, my radio playhouse,YourRadioPlayhousecontinues.Act Three: Act ThreeIra GlassThis isYourRadioPlayhouse.Small Scale Sin on today's program. I'm Ira Glass.So Eli was a big-time computer hacker. He and his friends were thrown into prison for this. He served six months. And here's what he says about his time in the big house.EliIt was so fun. I have to say, I had fun. It was a good experience. And I don't regret going there, actually.Ira GlassI think a lot of people are going to hear this and feel a certain horror. They're going to feel like, well, people should be punished.EliOh yeah. What I did was a bad thing, and I don't suggest anybody else do it, because that would be wrong. I don't do anything illegal anymore.Ira GlassThis is a story of someone who does not fear hell or punishment. It's a story of somebody who's been put into the position of defining for himself what is right and what is wrong. Starting in the mid-1980s, Eli was a member of a crew of computer hackers called MOD. At the time, journalists from theVillageVoiceandEsquiremagazine documented just how much they were able to do.It is entirely possible that no group of American computer hackers has before or since gotten so far in breaking into other people's computers. They infiltrated dozens of business and government networks. The reporters fromEsquire, at one point, asked them to demonstrate their skills by breaking into the White House computer system. And then they watched them do it.But for MOD, their real love was the biggest, most complicated computer system in the world, the phone system. They were in at the highest level computers that run the phone system for New York and New England. And this way, they could assign any services to any phone, listen to any phone, disconnect or create accounts, get unlisted phone numbers, or bring the entire phone system down.Eli served six months in a minimum-security prison and six months on home confinement. I spoke with him this summer, while he was still on home confinement in his parents' house in Queens.EliThe prison I had gone to was very relaxed. We played tennis, basketball. We had tournaments and got trophies. It was at Allenwood FPC. And playing Monopoly with the other inmates and Scrabble and stuff, it was just a wild concept.And then when I came back here, it actually bummed me out that I had to be home all day. It was like, where does this make sense? They're doing me a favor by letting me out, yet I had more fun in there. Something's not right. Something was very not right.It was more like a fame camp. People who were known and people who were involved in high-profile cases went there. That's what it was.I had a couple of really good friends there. My best friend there was a fellow by the name of Chris who lived out in San Diego and was involved in marijuana dealing. And he used to sell it through the mail. And he got caught. And they took away about $350,000 from him. And he's my age, probably 23, 24, something like that.And it was sad that he got five years. He was a nice guy. He was just like me. And we would hang out all the time.And across from me on the other side of my room was a man they used to call the Condo King. And he lived in Massachusetts in a castle that was probably worth $5 million and had butlers and Rolls Royces and this and that. And it was a real castle and right on the water.And he taught me about real estate, which was the funny thing. So I learned real estate from him. I learned about stocks. I learned from the best. And it was such a great experience. It was like college all over again.The attitude there was that of camaraderie. Everybody there had this one thing in common, and that was that they looked for the shortest way possible to achieve what they wanted to achieve. And they all got there at some point. And they just felt a stroke of bad luck, I suppose.There were no losers there, that's for sure. Everybody there had achieved a very high level of success, were very well known in whatever they did. And I was friends with all the mobsters there. And they took care of me and stuff because I was from New York and I knew about Little Italy and Mulberry and the Village and stuff.And when I went there, it was like, hey, another guy from New York. Kid's from the streets. And they were just impressed because I was the only hacker in this whole compound. So everybody knew me. As soon as I got there, a day later, everybody was blabbing, hey, there's this hacker in here. Even the guards were telling the inmates, hey, that guy's in here for this.Ira GlassOutside, in the hacking community, Eli was pretty well known. Actually, he was known by his handle, which was Acid Phreak. That's \"Phreak\" with a P-H at the beginning of it. Inside, in prison, he got all sorts of job offers. It turns out that lots of people in prison can use the services of a computer hacker.EliEverything from obtaining credit cards to changing credit to-- yeah, changing credit was a big thing. Because, I don't know if you know about this, but every time these real estate guys get busted, their credit usually goes down the tubes. One big request I had was to change a lot of credit reports and stuff. And I didn't do that and didn't take it seriously. I just told them, yeah, it was possible, but you're not going to get it from me.And there was a lot of mobsters who wanted me to set up phone lines for them that couldn't be detected by the police and things like that. And again, \"Well, it's possible. But I can't do that for you.\" But then again, if you were to ask me that and I was to do it, I wouldn't tell you anyway. So that's kind of a question that's hard to answer.Come into my domain. This is my room. As you can see, it's a typical teenager room.Ira GlassWell, actually, it was only sort of typical. The bedroom that he lives in during his six-month home confinement is tiny, barely enough space for a bed, a desk, and a bookshelf. There's a TV and a VCR, two computers. He flips on the stereo.EliI don't know. I guess I've got kind of a lot of equipment around here. I've got a fax machine here. In my room, I've got five phone lines. I got a two-line phone, but I've got everything else connected to computers or fax.Ira GlassThere were cheesy kung fu movies on video. On his CD player, there was old-school rap, Nine Inch Nails, the Doors, Jimi Hendrix. And then he says, \"Let me show you the good stuff,\" and he pulls out Xeroxes of old spiral notebooks.EliI have here what was seized from me but they had to return back to me. Here's my evidence examination report by the United States Secret Service. Subject, Acid Phreak. These notes have basically all the systems I got into. Look, I have little sketches and diagrams of how things work, different protocols and networks, definitions. See, a lot of this stuff was really good. I had stuff outside the country, NASA.Ira GlassThe something defense? What is that?EliGovernment defense.Ira GlassGovernment defense.EliYeah, that's a Washington number. McDonald's, since I had Telenet, I had McDonald's accounts. If you're a McDonald's employee, I could raise your pay. So that way, you get $15 an hour for shuffling burgers and stuff.Ira GlassSo did you decide just at random to help someone out?EliI didn't do it to anybody. I just wanted to know how.We did this from pay phones. We'd have a line of pay phones. We'd get into the computer, first liberate one phone. \"Liberating\" meaning make it so that you don't need quarters for that pay phone. You just pick up and dial like a regular house phone. So that way, we could make an endless amount of phone calls without putting quarters.Next step was to get into the network, find a session that was already going, and then knock them off while they were connected, and then sit there, watching them. In other words, put us in the place of the computer they were going to connect to. So the next time they'd try to log in, they would get our computer. And we'd type in, \"login.\" And they'd put in their login account.Then we'd go, \"password,\" you know? The password. They'd say, \"OK, password,\" and they'd put their password in. And then we would have-- all these things were already encoded in one key, so we could just hit one key. And it wouldn't look like we were typing it.Ira GlassLogin would just appear, whoomp. Input password, whoomp.EliLogin. And then we'd hit the password key, and password would come out. And then we'd say \"Login incorrect\" and then disconnect from them. But we already got their login and password.And then when they reconnected, it would be the regular system. So they'd figure, hey, I made a mistake typing it in or something. And that's how we would get in accounts. It was funny.You get into things that are good. You start targeting systems that are interesting. And then you start developing a collection. It's like baseball cards. I have NASA. I have NSA. I've got the phone company computers. I've got MISR. I've got Cosmos. I've got this. I've got that.McDonnell-Douglas, Marriott Marietta. TRW, CBI, TransUnion. What else can I get? You try to get the big names. So you start developing your collection.Then after a while, it became fun to look up famous people. Let's look up John Gotti's credit. Let's see what he owns. Let's look up Julia Roberts. Let's get her home phone number. Let's get this guy's home phone number.We'd go into pay phones and stuff. And hooking up, I would drive up to a pay phone real quick and do what I had to do and leave really quick. That's where I really got into a movie. I felt like it was likeMission:Impossible,like that whole gang. It was like-- [HUMMING \"MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE THEME\"].And we would all go out and hook up and everything. And it was like, \"Yeah, all right. I'm that black guy who does all this technical stuff. I can get into it. Let's go, let's go.\"I felt like we should have walkie-talkies and headsets and everything, and be like, \"OK, Blue. Go do your thing on five. Ready? Five, four three, you're in. You're in.\" It was just amazing after a while. And we were just so excited we were getting all that stuff. And it was just a rush. It was the flow.Once you start going, you can't stop. You're just steamrolling one after the other. And the flow gets you going, and then you're just like, \"Yeah, we rule. We're it.\" It breaks down all barriers. Nothing can stop the flow. If you've got the flow, you can conquer everything. That's what people call being in the zone. Once you're in there, you can't stop. It's the juice.Ira GlassIf anything, it's surprising how little they did with their power over computers. It was mostly pranks, making somebody's phone ring continuously, turning an enemy's home phone line into a pay phone line so when the guy picked up his phone at home, it demanded that he deposit a quarter. Of course, there was no way he could do that because it's his home phone.They did actually call Julia Roberts once. They called Queen Elizabeth, too. But there's an emptiness at the heart of a lot of these stories. Once you've got the Queen on the phone, what do you say?EliShe's like, \"Hello?\" She's talking to us and stuff. And we don't know what to say. \"Hi, we're calling from the United States, and this and that.\" And she knew what was up. She's like, \"OK, hello.\" And then she said goodbye, and that was it.We didn't know what to say. What do you say to Queen Elizabeth? \"Hi. So you see that movie,TrueLies?\"You know, what do you say? The fun of it is finding the number.Ira GlassEli was thrown into prison for a relatively minor offense. Some of the members of his crew broke into the computers that list everybody's credit ratings. And they copied some credit reports. And they sold the information to other people. And he was named as a member of this conspiracy.EliThey said we abused our power. But we didn't abuse it at all. We did nothing compared to the things that could have been done. What we did was such a small thing in such a larger scheme of things.It's kind of depressing, in a way. There's so many things we could have done. We could have monitored Peter Lynch. What's the next best investment for the day? And we'd make millions of dollars investing or shorting some stock. But we never did. And now we wonder why. We're like, \"Damn. There are so many applications for this kind of stuff. What happened?\" But then we're like, \"Ah, we were just kids.\"Then one time, one of us got theMadmagazine owner's phone number. And we called him. And that time, he was going through some rough times or something. And we were calling him for about two weeks. And he was just so goofy. He was kind of crazy. And he was just really stressed or something. And we just kept calling him and calling him.And finally, we started harassing him and harassing him. We'd make fun of him and laugh at him and call him Alfred E. Neuman. And just ridicule him. And then he got so mad at us. And we used to keep calling and screwing around with him.And then one day, we read in a paper he died. The day after we had called him, he passes away. And we're there like, \"Yo, did we kill him? I hope not.\" And then they said he had some nervous breakdown and this and that. We're like, \"Oh my god. Oh my god. I think we contributed to his demise there. We better not tell anybody this.\" But then we realized that there was probably other factors that contributed to it, not just a kid calling him on the phone. But since then, we stopped doing things like that because it was like, \"Oh my god.\"I don't destroy computers. I don't take them down. I don't delete information that shouldn't be deleted. I think there's something morally wrong if you affect a person personally in not only his computer life, but his personal life, his right to make a living. I think that's wrong. It's just a question of morality.Ira GlassOne thing about the computer world is that it's all so new. And hacking on computers is so new that each person who does it feels like he or she can create his or her own moral code. And Eli's crew had its own particular code of behavior. For example, unlike most hackers, they didn't share what they knew with other hackers.EliWe had complete control over certain networks. We could have any system we wanted on that network. Any host was ours. But you don't let it get out to other hacking groups and other hackers. Because if they don't know how to use it, they don't understand the power of it all, you can't trust them. It's too much power for some people.Basically, it's like having a gun. Let's say it's the Wild West. You take it upon yourself to have a gun, you're responsible for it. If you give that to someone, you're responsible for that. So you don't give it out. If you want to shoot somebody's sister, somebody's wife or something, that's upon you. It's all a question of morality in my eyes.And if I know something, and it's of importance to somebody else, who's to tell me I can't sell it if I know it? Like if I knew something about you that somebody would pay a price for, it's up to me and my own morality whether I would sell it to him or not. But nobody could tell me, \"You can't do that.\"Like if I know about your credit history, and somebody comes up to me and says, \"I'm doing background on him. I want to know. Can you get me his credit history?\" If I think it's immoral, I'm not going to do it. But if for some reason I think that he's going to get it anyway, and it would benefit me, I'd probably give it to him anyway.We're not evil people. We're good people at heart. There was a time when me and my friend, Nynex Phreak, another guy in the group, we found a system that actually, what it did was you could input a certain series of digits. It would take those digits and see if it was a credit card. So you could basically hack out credit card numbers just by guessing. Is this a credit card? And it would tell you if it was or not. And we found that system.Finally, somebody wrote a program that would automatically do it, scan all night and get thousands of credit cards. And we're like, yeah, this is no good. What if they start selling credit cards and stuff? We're like, this is no good. So we actually called the FBI and told them about it.We wouldn't narc on anybody. We wouldn't say who wrote it or anything. We just said, there's a system, and it isn't right it's open like that. It was just getting ridiculous.So I was like, \"We've got to put an end to this.\" And we did that. And we were like, \"Damn. We can't tell any hacker we did this. They'll be pissed.\" And we felt like that was right to do. That's kind of wrong.Ira GlassIt is because of their own moral code in their group, and also their belief that someday hacking will no longer be seen as a crime, that society will change its ideas about information and computers and breaking into computers, that Eli is able to say something like this next quote about his time in the big house.EliI was a criminal in the sense that Jesus Christ was a criminal, you know? Well, you know how he was thought to be a criminal. And he was sentenced and everything. And now look. Everybody's sporting crosses. And there's churches built around him and everything. Who knows? Maybe one day, it'll be Acid Phreak, the faith. You never know.Ira GlassIn fact, when I was visiting Eli, he was facing a daily question of right and wrong when it came to his own home confinement. The prison system was keeping track of him during home confinement with this electronic device. It was about the size of a beeper. It was riveted onto an ankle strap.And it would send this signal to a computer that authorities had put into his house. And that computer would call another computer any time that he would leave the house. And as he explained, hacking these computers and the phone line that connected them was pretty easy work.But he did not do it. He said he just didn't want to get in any more trouble. He said he was going straight. And it wasn't because he thought hacking was wrong. It was that he was just tired of it.EliWe had lists and lists of computers and no time to do it in. It just got to the point where it was such a large burden. It was like, \"Aw, man. We got to do this one. Aw, there's another one we got to do.\" And then it got to hundreds and hundreds. And finally, it's not even fun anymore.It was such a rush to get it when you initially get it. But then, I don't know. It gets to be boring. I've just burned myself out, I think. I just got to that point where everybody gets burnt out if they have a little too much of everything.Ira GlassNow, though he was burned out, it was still a shock when the federal authorities seized all of his computers and he wasn't allowed to hack anymore. This was back when he was first arrested.EliIt was like, OK, what do I do? I usually get on the computer now, late at night and stuff. And you'd just go to sleep. And then my lifestyle started changing. I'd be sleeping at night again. So I was like, \"Damn. This is like-- I have to fill this void. What should I do?\" And I didn't know what to do anymore. It was horrible.It was sad. We would call each other up. And usually, we'd be talking about computers and trading passwords, and then we'd get into this and that. And I remember, the first time we called, it was like, \"So, what's up?\" \"Nothing. I cleaned my room yesterday.\" \"Yeah, they came over and cleaned my room, too, pretty well.\" \"Yeah, I know.\" \"So what do you want to do?\" \"I don't know.\"Because it's such a large part of our lives at that point. You have so much power and to lose it in an instant like that is just such a shock. It's like, bam. You don't have that power anymore. You can't sit on your computer. What are you going to do? Uh-oh, I'm a regular guy now. I'm not Acid Phreak anymore. What's Acid Phreak without a computer? He's just a regular guy. So it was a bummer.At this point, I've already done it. I see it as a teenager thing. OK, I was a hacker when I was a kid and this and that. I got busted. It's a teenager thing to do. And that's that. I move on. I work with computers now, and that's my life.Ira GlassWell, Acid Phreak was not the first criminal who told me that he quit being bad because he got bored with it. A few Chicago gang members have told me the same thing, that you end up having the same night over and over again. You just get tired of it.Maybe you remember the bookAClockworkOrange,the book and the movie. They're about teenage boys who love ultra-violence, commit murder, do all sorts of horrible things, speak to each other in a very stylized language.At the end of that book-- the movie actually doesn't end this way, but the original British edition of the novel does. At the end of the book, the central character gives up committing acts of violence. And it's not because he thinks it's wrong. And it's not because any of the punishments and treatments that he's received have worked on him.He gives it up because he's bored with it. It's just not that interesting to him. And we will end our program today with a couple of paragraphs from the book.\"I knew what was happening, O my brothers. I was like growing up. Yes yes yes, there it is. Youth must go. Ah, yes. But youth is only being in a way like it might be an animal. No, it is not just like being an animal so much as being like one of those malenky toys you viddy being sold in the streets, like little chellovecks made out of tin, with a spring inside and then a winding handle on the outside. And you wind it up, grrr grrr grrr and off it itties, like walking, O my brothers. But it itties in a straight line. And it bangs straight into things, bang bang. And it cannot help what it is doing. Being young is like being one of those malenky machines.\"And then at this point, the narrator starts going into this fantasy about having a son someday. And he says, \"When I had my son, I would like to explain all that to him, when he was starry enough to like understand. But then I knew he would not understand, or would not want to understand at all, and would do all the veshches I had done, yes perhaps even killing some poor starry forella surrounded with mewing kots and koshkas. And I would not be able to really stop him. And nor would he be able to stop his own son, brothers. And so it would itty on like that to the end of the world, round and round and round, like some bolshy, gigantic like chelloveck, like old Bog Himself, turning and turning and turning, a vonny grahzny orange in his gigantic rookers.\"CreditsIra GlassWell, this episode ofYourRadioPlayhousewas produced by WBEZ Chicago with generous funding from the MacArthur Foundation.

If you are able, we strongly encourage you to listen to the audio, which includes emotion and emphasis that's not on the page. Transcripts are generated using a combination of speech recognition software and human transcribers. In 1983, he was one of the first victims of AIDS. He died before his children got the chance to ask him about who he really was. Susan Bergman wrote a book about her family's experience. Gay men, who were still married or who had been married, contacted her. Act One: The Book Tour. Act Two: A gay man talks to me in a parked car in an undisclosed location. Act Three: We take all the heavy, very heavy themes about lying and families and rework them as comedy. And finally, Act Four: The sins of the fathers pass on to the sons. Susan Bergman: \"There's always the resentment that you had to go through the pain\" \"You live with that resentment. It really never quite goes away, even in my case, after you've come completely out and divorced\" \"The resentment lives on, that I had to do live that lie,\" she says. \"And never be happy. Never, never, never know happiness\" Susan Bergman: I hope I can do this without just kind of gushing all over you, because it's so great of you to call in and offer that. I didn't get that chance with my father. I guess I would ask you--Ira Glass: As you're listening, you're making the gagging signal. Ira Glass: If what you really need is a long talk with your father, then no stranger on a radio call-in show, however well meaning, is going to give that to you. Glass: There you are. You're talking to this man, this stranger. And you find yourself asking a version of the question that you would most like to ask your own father. Gay men sent Susan Bergman photos of themselves. One letter said that if her father had lived and divorced her mother, this is the kind of happiness he could have had. Letters from children and spouses of gay fathers seemed to be written in a completely different language than the letters she got from the gay fathers. Ira Glass: Families who are in that situation felt this shock of we are not alone. And they contacted her. The most poignant letter that I got, this woman says she read the book. \"Our lives are so similar, Susan, that it was eerie for me to read\" Susan Bergman: The family had just buried their mother, who had died of AIDS. She says the father didn't protect the mother at all. \"Now, they are both gone. And we are left to deal with the fraud that was our life\" As her father was dying, Susan Bergman's children interviewed him about his sexual contacts. They got the names of all of the married men that he had been with in this three-city area. They began calling those men's wives on the telephone, because they wanted to save lives. Susan Bergman: \"I can see why if you lose your mother to AIDS, I never had to do that\" In a town I live in, outside Chicago, there is a family, at least one, where the same thing is going on. The father is very promiscuous, a prominent man in town, has four young children. Susan Bergman: I can't go into their lives just because I wrote some book on some related subject. If they're involved in the family system in some way, they have to make that decision. When I talk to gay men about this book, who have read it and want to have a conversation, almost everyone has said to me, \"Oh yeah, my main partners are married men\" \"I strongly feel that your father's life with you and your family was not the sham it may superficially appear\" \"I see the story from a different perspective, as that of a tragic, often unconscious struggle by your father to love his family and not end up as one of nature's mistakes, which of course he wasn't\" \"I had a great Daddy in many regards. Yes, he was a split person. And I don't think that he enjoyed being split, and neither does this gentleman\" \"I think I was well-loved by my father. But that doesn't make him a better father,\" he says. Coming up, a gay father explains why he chooses not to tell his children of his double life. The man we found to interview for this has been married for 26 years, heads a support group for men in similar circumstances. He was willing to be interviewed, but he didn't want me coming to his home. Jerry Walters says he was always a good boy. He says he doesn't really get at angry people, doesn't know how to yell at people. Back in high school, he says, he'd go out with girls, but never make passes at them. Ira Glass had his first gay experience the day he married the girl he's still married to. Soon after their wedding, he became increasingly obsessed with men. He found himself driving out to the forest preserves, where gay men were known to hang out. Ira Glass asks Jerry Walters about his obsession with another man. Walters: \"You're not sure who you want to do it with or where these people are\" Walters says his wife became the person that was stopping him from pursuing what he had to do to survive. Jerry Walters: I've got these feelings for men and I don't know how to deal with them. I'm one of these people that holds the door open for women and very courteous with people. So I held it inside. And you think the top of your head is going to blow off. \"I didn't marry part of you. We'll just figure out how to deal with it,\" Ira Glass says of his relationship with his wife. \"I want to be the most important person in your life,\" she says. \"And she always has been and she always will be,\" he says. Jerry Walters: There's a difference between gay feelings and living the gay lifestyle. He says there's no easy time to sit your kids down and tell them that you're gay. Walters: When they hit adolescence, it could be confusing, a kind of burden. Jerry Walters says his children accept him for who he is. But they don't actually know entirely who you are, because you keep a certain part from them, he says. He says they'll ask when they're ready to hear the answer. If you want to know something, you will ask the question. Jerry Walters says his wife doesn't want anybody to know he has a sex life outside of the marriage. He says he'd like to tell his daughters the truth, but his wife wants him to respect her wishes. Jerry says he's not as sexually attracted to women as he is to men. To Jerry, being an adult means having a wife, a house in the burbs, a couple kids, dinner parties, and mortgage payments. \"How could I be anything other than what I am? And that was to be a married man\" In the suburbs, it's not commonplace. In the city it's accepted. There are areas in the city where men can hold hands. You won't find that in the suburbs. long-term, marriage-like relationships are commonplace among the gay men I know. Ira Glass: Her father was, on the surface anyway, presented the image of being a family man, a very religious man. He was a musician in their church. And so there was this constant lie, because--Jerry WaltersWhere is the lie? Was he all of those things, plus one other thing? We are complicated individuals. Act Three: Lighten UpIra Glass: There are lots of trivial lies that parents tell. He says he urges men to think very seriously about what they'll be giving up if they choose to quit their marriages. Glass: A secret that my mom has kept from her kids involves sex. The Neo-Futurists are a Chicago group who perform 30 plays in 60 minutes every Friday and Saturday night. They prepared this play, they call it a play. It's by Greg Allen, a recent father himself. The play is called \"Twenty-one lies I will tell my children\" Greg Allen, Diana Slickman, Dave Awl, Heather Riordan, David Kodeski, Anita Loomis, and Stephanie Shaw, of the Neo-Futurists. Their parents can surprise us with what they don't tell us, especially when it comes to sex. My ex-girlfriend was in the gym, looking through a copy of aMarieClairemagazine. In the third paragraph, one of the sexperts turns out to be my mother. \"Your man wants a woman who excites him through her own excitement\" Anaheed was at the gym. And she opens upMarieClaireto an article called, \"Men's Sexual Fantasies\" \"Sexperts reveal the six most common scenarios, unlock the secret longings and psyches of the modern men who fantasize\" Shirley Glass: I might make a joke or say something that had a sexual connotation, and I'd get this disapproval. I think it has to do with that children, even adult children, do not like to regard their parents' sexuality. to around them. Shirley Glass: I heard a wonderful joke, but I don't even know if it's a joke or story. Because this is like something that might be true.Ira Glass: When Neil Armstrong walked on the moon, and he said, one giant step for man and one-- what is it? Shirley Glass: I did get very nervous there, in a way that does not correspond, perhaps, with shrugging my shoulders at the notion of you having some sexual life and sexual thoughts.Ira Glass: Well, now I'm examining my own feelings. Shirley Glass: We've gone to restaurants with you and pretended we didn't know you. I think everybody-- yeah. Daddy would look at you. And he would start popping Gelusil, before we'd go out to eat. And I'd say, now Barry, people are going to look at him and they're going to looks at him. Act Four: Sins Of The Fathers. Susan Bergman's book,Anonymity,is her trying to understand the two parts of her father, strict and strict. Dr. Shirley Glass, in Baltimore, is a well-known sexpert. Susan Bergman's husband is a religious, family man; promiscuous, gay, night clubber. His personality was split in half, she writes, into two irreconcilable halves. She found herself as an adult, leading a double life. \"I saw the way Tom looked at you.\" \"There's absolutely nothing for you to worry about between me and anyone here tonight. Most definitely nothing's up with Tom.\" \"Do you have any secrets from me?\" \"A few.\" She'll keep it light. There's a family with children on the line. I force my family to serve as the same kind of false front I was raised to be from my father. Here was my father's ailment again, his dread of being known. Our presence testified to his normality. We failed, no matter how we strove for blessing, to discover the root of our calamity. If her hands are clean and her heart pure, I had been forgiven. But I had yet to go to the man I had wronged, and whom I desperately wanted to love me. All that we had made together did not add up to the ultimate banishment of the untruthful from the presence of God. Ira Glass: I made an offer of honesty, yes, but hadn't thought the test would come so soon. Glass: Maybe it was a morning unlike any my father had ever been given. \"Whatever the consequence,\" I said inside my head to remind myself, breathing once. Ira Glass: Susan Bergman's father led a double life. He was a church organist in a denomination so strict the women covered their heads. He stage-managed things so they appeared to be a normal family. Cushing, and the mysterious and elusive Rumpety Rattles. Susan Bergman wrote a book about her family's experience. Gay men, who were still married or who had been married, started to contact her. They wanted to explain her father's double life to her. And they wanted to offer her the conversation that she never got to have with her father. Today's program in four acts. I talk to Susan Bergman about her father. Act Two, a gay man talks to me in a parked car in an undisclosed location. Act Three, we take all the heavy, very heavy themes about lying and families and rework them as comedy. Susan Bergman: I'm a gay father, divorced now. So I'm very close to this. In particular, I can understand your father's secretiveness and his pain. There's always the resentment that you had to go through the pain. And you live with that resentment. Susan Bergman: I would have to contest that assumption that one has to lie or one is put in a situation where lying is the only appropriate gesture or response. Man: Is there anything that I can help you. Because I'm still alive and I've been through it. Ira Glass: If what you really need is a long talk with your father, then no stranger on a radio call-in show, however well meaning, is going to give that to you. Glass: Whatever anger I would have had towards my father didn't seem to me to apply to him. Gay men sent Susan Bergman photos of themselves. One letter said that if her father had lived and divorced her mother, this is the kind of happiness he could have had. She said the letters that she got from the children and spouses of gay fathers seemed to be written in a completely different language. There are lots of books about men coming out. But nobody seemed to be able to remember a book that had been told from the point of view of the children and the wives that these gay men had left behind. And families who are in that situation felt this shock of we are not alone. Susan Bergman: A Chicago family lost both their parents to AIDS. She says the family wrote to her asking for help. They did come to Chicago. Two of the daughters came. Some of the sons were not willing to even acknowledge that the parents had died of AIDS yet. As her father was dying, they spent hours and hours interviewing their father on tape about his sexual contacts. They got the names of all of the married men that he had been with in this three-city area. And they began calling those men's wives on the telephone, because they wanted to save lives. Susan Bergman: It's such a complicated act, because partly it's an act of compassion for somebody. And then it's such anact of vengeance against somebody else, and calling out that man. go on. And they said a lot of women hung up the phone. Susan Bergman: I don't know the people. I can't go into their lives just because I wrote some book on some related subject. But when I talk to gay men about this book, who have read it and want to have a conversation, almost everyone has said to me, \"Oh yeah, my main partners are married men\" \"I did the one right thing. I left my family and became a true homosexual,\" Bergman writes. \"I see the story from a different perspective, as that of a tragic, often unconscious struggle by your father to love his family,\" he writes. I think I was well-loved by my father. I think my father was a split person, and that that destroyed him and it worked towards the destruction of his family. And that's almost the thing that this letter is driving towards, like couldn't you be doubly loved, being loved by a homosexual father? No. Coming up, a gay father explains why he chooses not to tell his children of his double life. The man we found to interview for this has been married for 26 years, heads a support group, called Review. He was willing to be interviewed, but he didn't want me coming to his home. Jerry Walters says he was always a good boy. He says he doesn't really get at angry people, doesn't know how to yell at people. Back in high school, he says, he was the kind of boy who'd go out with girls, but never make passes. Ira Glass had his first gay experience the day he met his wife. He went on to marry the girl, who he's still married to nearly three decades later. But soon after their wedding, he became increasingly obsessed with men. He found himself driving out to the forest preserves, where gay men were known to hang out. Ira Glass: Jerry Walters' obsession with another man led him to take tranquilizers. Glass: His wife became the person that was stopping him from pursuing what he absolutely, positively had to do to survive. \"Your thinking gets distorted, would be an understatement,\" Glass says. Jerry Walters: I'm one of these people that holds the door open for women and very courteous with people. So I held it inside. And it's something that we-- here's a very mild mannered person, almost plotting somebody's demise, because they're stopping you. Ira Glass says his wife wanted to know where he would be when she needed him. \"I'm going out for sex, not for sleeping,\" he says. Glass: \"I want to be the most important person in your life\" Jerry Walters: There's a difference between gay feelings and living the gay lifestyle. There is an arrested adolescence in the gay community, he says. He says he's not really lying to his children by not telling them he's gay. Walters: honesty is something that I really put a high price on and I really value it. Jerry Walters says his children accept him for who he is, but they don't actually know entirely who you are, because you keep a certain part from them. If his children ask him directly he says, then he'll tell the truth. He says, they'll ask when they're ready to hear the answer. Jerry says that he'd like to tell his daughters the truth, but his wife doesn't want him to. He feels he has to respect her wishes. She knows the marriage works for them and simply doesn't. want to have to put up with the opinions of people who won't understand. Jerry Walters says he's not sexually attracted to women as much as he is to men. He stayed in his marriage partly because he couldn't imagine any other life for himself. To Jerry, being an adult means having a wife, a house in the burbs, a couple kids and dinner parties. Ira Glass tells Jerry Walters that these kind of long-term, marriage-like relationships are commonplace among the gay men I know. In the suburbs, it's not commonplace. There are areas in the city where men can hold hands. You won't find that in the suburbs. Ira Glass: Her father was, on the surface anyway, presented the image of being a family man, a very religious man. He was a musician in their church. And he was just this one more thing, that he didn't choose to share with her. And I think that was his privilege. Act Three: Lighten Up. Jerry says he talks to about 260 men a year in the support group he leads for gay and bisexual married men. He urges men to think very seriously about what they'll be giving up if they choose to quit their marriages. The Neo-Futurists are a Chicago group who perform 30 plays in 60 minutes every Friday and Saturday night. They prepared this play on our theme today. It's by Greg Allen, a recent father himself. The play is called \"Twenty-one lies I will tell my children\" Greg Allen, Diana Slickman, Dave Awl, Heather Riordan, David Kodeski, Anita Loomis, and Stephanie Shaw are members of the Neo-Futurists. Their show, \"Curtain,\" airs on PBS stations in the U.S. An ex-girlfriend was in the gym, looking through a copy of aMarieClairemagazine, a woman's magazine. In the third paragraph, one of the sexperts turns out to be my mother. \"Your man wants a woman who excites him through her own excitement\" Shirley Glass was quoted inMarieClaire.com. She says she didn't know she was a sexpert. She's just another Jewish mom and psychologist, she says. \"I think I'm just going to let that go. it.\" Shirley Glass: I might make a joke or say something that had a sexual connotation, and I'd get this disapproval. I think it has to do with that children, even adult children, do not like to regard their parents' sexuality. So therefore, I tend not to around them. Shirley Glass: I heard a wonderful joke, but I don't even know if it's a joke or story. Because this is like something that might be true. Neil Armstrong walked on the moon, and he said, one giant step for man and one-- what is it? Shirley Glass: I did get very nervous there, in a way that does not correspond, perhaps, with shrugging my shoulders at the notion of you having some sexual life and sexual thoughts.Ira Glass: Well, now I'm examining my own feelings. Shirley Glass: I've gone to restaurants with you and pretended we didn't know you. I think everybody-- yeah. Daddy would look at you. And he would start popping Gelusil, before we'd go out to eat. And I'd go along with it. Act Four: Sins Of The Fathers. What does it do to children if parents tell a big lie for years? Part of Susan Bergman's \"Sins of the Fathers\" Dr. Shirley Glass, in Baltimore, was the author's mother. Susan Bergman's book, Anonymity, is about trying to understand the two parts of her father. His personality was split in half, she writes, into two irreconcilable halves. She found herself as an adult, leading a double life. \"I saw the way Tom looked at you.\" \"There's absolutely nothing for you to worry about between me and anyone here tonight\" \"Do you have any secrets from me?\" \"A few.\" She'll keep it light. \"This is not my natural hair color, quite. But the rest is real.\" There's a family with children on the line. I force my family to serve as the same kind of false front I was raised to be from my father. Our presence testified to his normality. We failed, no matter how we strove for blessing, to discover the root of our calamity. If her hands are clean and her heart pure, I had been forgiven. But I had yet to go to the man I had wronged, and whom I desperately wanted to love me. All that we had made together did not add up to the ultimate banishment of the untruthful. Ira Glass left her father's house to start a new life on her own. She says she made an offer of honesty, but hadn't thought the test would come so soon. Glass: \"This was the last of my life, as I knew it\" Ira Glass: You'll get oral sex from me the day that boy next door walks on the moon. This American Life is produced by WBEZ in Chicago.
